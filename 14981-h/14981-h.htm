<h4>I. ISLAM IN THE MIDDLE AGES.</h4>


<p>The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela throws a flashlight upon one of
the most interesting stages in the development of nations.</p>

<p>The history of the civilized world from the downfall of the Roman
Empire to the present day may be summarized as the struggle between
Cross and Crescent. This struggle is characterized by a persistent ebb
and flow. Mohammed in 622 A.D. transformed, as if by magic, a cluster
of Bedouin tribes into a warlike people. An Arabian Empire was formed,
which reached from the Ebro to the Indus. Its further advance was
stemmed in the year 732, just a hundred years after Mohammed's death,
by Charles Martel, in the seven days' battle of Tours.</p>

<p>The progress of the culture of the Arabs was as rapid as had been that
of their arms. Great cities such as Cairo and Bagdad were built.
Commerce and manufactures flourished. The Jews, who enjoyed protection
under the benign rule of the Caliphs, transmitted to the Arabs the
learning and science of the Greeks. Schools and universities arose in
all parts of the Empire. The dark age of Christendom proved to be the
golden age of literature for Jew and Arab.</p>

<p>By the eleventh century, however, the Arabs had lost much of their
martial spirit. Islam might have lost its ascendancy in the East had
not the warlike Seljuk Turks, coming from the highlands of Central
Asia, possessed themselves of the countries which, in days of old,
constituted the Persian Empire under Darius. The Seljuks became ready
converts to Islam, and upheld the failing strength of the Arabs.</p>
<p>It was the ill-treatment by the Seljuks of the Christian pilgrims to<a name="bpage_viii"></a>
Palestine which aroused Christian Europe and led to the First Crusade.
The feudal system adopted by the Seljuks caused endless dissension
among their petty sovereigns, called &quot;Atabegs&quot;, all of whom were
nominally vassals of the Caliph at Bagdad. Thus it came about that
Islamism, divided against itself, offered but a poor resistance to the
advance of the Christians. The Crusaders had little difficulty in
making their way to Palestine. They captured Jerusalem, and
established the Latin kingdom there.</p>

<p>By the middle of the twelfth century Mohammedan power had shrunk to
smaller dimensions. Not only did the Franks hold Palestine and all the
important posts on the Syrian coast, but, by the capture of Lesser
Armenia, Antioch, and Edessa, they had driven a wedge into Syria, and
extended their conquests even beyond the Euphrates.</p>

<p>At length there came a pause in the decline of Islam. Zengi, a
powerful Seljuk Atabeg, in 1144 captured Edessa, the outpost of
Christendom, and the Second Crusade, led by the Emperor Conrad of
Germany and by King Louis VII of France, failed to effect the
recapture of the fortress. Nureddin, the far-sighted son and successor
of Zengi, and later on Saladin, a Kurd, trained at his court,
discovered how to restore the fallen might of Islam and expel the
Franks from Asia. A necessary preliminary step was to put an end to
the dissensions of the Atabeg rulers. Nureddin did this effectually by
himself annexing their dominions. His next step was to gain possession
of Egypt, and thereby isolate the Latin Kingdom. Genoa, Pisa, and
Venice, the three Italian republics who between them had command of
the sea, were too selfish and too intent upon their commercial
interests to interfere with the designs of the Saracens. The Latin
king Amalric had for some years sought to gain a foothold in Egypt. In
November, 1168, he led the Christian army as far as the Nile, and was
about to seize Fostat, the old unfortified Arab metropolis of Egypt.
The inhabitants, however, preferred to set fire to the city rather
than that it should fall into the hands of the Christians. To this
very day many traces may be seen in the neighbourhood of Cairo of this
conflagration. Nureddin's army, in which Saladin held a subordinate<a name="bpage_ix"></a>
command, by a timely arrival on the scene forced the Franks to
retreat, and the Saracens were acclaimed as deliverers.</p>

<p>The nominal ruler of Egypt at that time was El-Adid, the Fatimite
Caliph, and he made Saladin his Vizier, little thinking that that
modest officer would soon supplant him. So efficiently did Saladin
administer the country that in a few months it had regained its
prosperity, despite the five years' devastating war which had
preceded.</p>

<p>At this juncture the traveller Rabbi Benjamin came to Egypt. Some
three years earlier he had left his native place&mdash;Tudela, on the Ebro
in the north of Spain. After passing through the prosperous towns
which lie on the Gulf of Lyons, he visited Rome and South Italy. From
Otranto he crossed over to Corfu, traversed Greece, and then came to
Constantinople, of which he gives an interesting account. Very
telling, for example, are the words: &quot;They hire from amongst all
nations warriors called Barbarians to fight with the Sultan of the
Seljuks; for the natives are not warlike, but are as women who have no
strength to fight.&quot; After visiting the Islands of the Aegean, as well
as Rhodes and Cyprus, he passed on to Antioch, and followed the
well-known southern route skirting the Mediterranean, visiting the
important cities along the coast, all of which were then in the hands
of the Franks.</p>

<p>Having regard to the strained relations between the Christians and
Saracens, and to the fights and forays of the Latin knights, we can
understand that Benjamin had to follow a very circuitous way to enable
him to visit all the places of note in Palestine. From Damascus, which
was then the capital of Nureddin's empire, he travelled along with
safety until he reached Bagdad, the city of the Caliph, of whom he has
much to tell.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that he went far into Persia, which at that time was in
a chaotic state, and where the Jews were much oppressed. From Basra,
at the mouth of the Tigris, he probably visited the island of Kish in
the Persian Gulf, which in the Middle Ages was a great emporium of
commerce, and thence proceeded to Egypt by way of Aden and Assuan.</p>
<a name="bpage_x"></a>
<p>Benjamin gives us a vivid sketch of the Egypt of his day. Peace and
plenty seemed to prevail in the country. This happy state of things
was entirely due to the wise measures taken by Saladin, who, however,
kept himself so studiously in the background, that not even his name
is mentioned in the Itinerary. The deposition of the Fatimite Caliph
on Friday, September 10, 1171, and his subsequent death, caused little
stir. Saladin continued to govern Egypt as Nureddin's lieutenant. In
due course he made himself master of Barca and Tripoli; then he
conquered Arabia Felix and the Soudan, and after Nureddin's death he
had no difficulty in annexing his old master's dominions. The
Christian nations viewed his rapidly growing power with natural alarm.</p>

<p>About that time news had reached Europe that a powerful Christian king
named Prester John, who reigned over a people coming from Central
Asia, had invaded Western Asia and inflicted a crushing defeat upon a
Moslem army. Pope Alexander III conceived the hope that a useful ally
could be found in this priest-king, who would support and uphold the
Christian dominion in Asia. He accordingly dispatched his physician
Philip on a mission to this mysterious potentate to secure his help
against the Mohammedans. The envoy never returned.</p>

<p>Benjamin is one of the very few writers of the Middle Ages who gives
us an account of these subjects of Prester John. They were no other
than the infidels, the sons of Ghuz, or Kofar-al-Turak, the wild
flat-nosed Mongol hordes from the Tartary Steppes, who, in Benjamin's
quaint language, &quot;worship the wind and live in the wilderness, who eat
no bread and drink no wine, but feed on uncooked meat. They have no
noses&mdash;in lieu thereof they have two small holes through which they
breathe.&quot;</p>

<p>These were not men likely to help the Christians. On the contrary, as
is so fully described in Benjamin's Itinerary, they broke the power of
Sultan Sinjar, the mighty Shah of Persia, who, had he been spared by
the men of Ghuz, would have proved a serious menace to Saladin.</p>

<p>It took Saladin some years to consolidate his empire.</p>
<a name="bpage_xi"></a>

<p>In 1187 he felt himself in a position to engage the Franks in a
decisive conflict. At the battle of Tiberias, Guy, the Latin king, was
defeated and taken prisoner. The Knights-Templars and Hospitalers, of
whose doings at Jerusalem Benjamin gives us particulars, either shared
the fate of the king or were slain in action. Jerusalem fell soon
afterwards. Pope Alexander III roused the conscience of Europe, and
induced the pick of chivalry to embark upon the Third Crusade in 1189.
But the prowess of the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa, the gallantry of
Richard I of England, the astuteness of Philip Augustus of France,
were of no avail. The Fourth and Fifth Crusades were equally
unsuccessful, and the tide of Islam's success rose high.</p>

<p>After Saladin's death his empire gradually crumbled to pieces, and
under Ghenghis Khan an invasion took place of hordes of Mongols and
Tartars, of whom the Ghuz had been merely the precursors. They overran
China and Russia, Persia, and parts of Western Asia. The effete
Caliphate at Bagdad was overthrown, but to Islam itself fresh life was
imparted. The rapid decline of the Mongol power at the end of the
thirteenth century gave free scope to the rise of the Ottoman Turks,
who had been driven from their haunts east of the Caspian Sea. Like
their kinsmen the Seljuks they settled in Asia Minor, and embraced the
Mohammedan faith, an example which many Mongols followed. The converts
proved trusty warriors to fight the cause of Islam, which gradually
attained the zenith of success. On May 29, 1453, Constantinople was
captured by the Turks, and an end was made of the Byzantine Empire.
Eastern Europe was subsequently overrun by them, and it was not until
John Sobieski defeated the Turks under the walls of Vienna in 1683
that their victorious career was checked.</p>

<p>Then at last the tide of Islam turned, and its fortunes have been
ebbing ever since. At the present day little territory remains to them
in Europe. India and Egypt are now subject to England; Russia has
annexed Central Asia; France rules Algiers and Tunis. One wonders
whether there will be a pause in this steady decline of Islam, and
<a name="bpage_xii"></a>
whether the prophetic words of Scripture will continue to hold good:
&quot;He will be a wild man, his hand will be against every man, and every
man's hand against him, and he shall dwell in the presence of all his
brethren.&quot;</p>

<p>This brief consideration of the struggle between Cross and Crescent
may serve to indicate the importance of the revival of Islam, which
took place between the Second and Third Crusades, at the time when
Benjamin wrote his Itinerary.</p>

<br />
<h4><a name="II_THE_OBJECT_OF_BENJAMINS_JOURNEY" id="II_THE_OBJECT_OF_BENJAMINS_JOURNEY"></a>II. THE
OBJECT OF BENJAMIN'S JOURNEY.</h4>


<p>We may ask what induced Benjamin to undertake his travels? What object
or mission was he carrying out?</p>

<p>It must be explained that the Jew in the Middle Ages was much given to
travel. He was the Wandering Jew, who kept up communications between
one country and another. He had a natural aptitude for trade and
travel. His people were scattered to the four corners of the earth. As
we can see from Benjamin's Itinerary, there was scarcely a city of
importance where Jews could not be found. In the sacred tongue they
possessed a common language, and wherever they went they could rely
upon a hospitable reception from their co-religionists. Travelling
was, therefore, to them comparatively easy, and the bond of common
interest always supplied a motive. Like Joseph, the traveller would be
dispatched with the injunction: &quot;I pray thee see whether it be well
with thy brethren, and bring me word again.&quot;</p>

<p>If this was the case in times when toleration and protection were
extended to the Jews, how much stronger must have grown the desire for
intercommunication at the time of the Crusades. The most prosperous
communities in Germany and the Jewish congregations that lay along the
route to Palestine had been exterminated or dispersed, and even in
Spain, where the Jews had enjoyed complete security for centuries,
they were being pitilessly persecuted in the Moorish kingdom of
Cordova.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely, therefore, that Benjamin may have <a name="bpage_xiii"></a>undertaken his
journey with the object of finding out where his expatriated brethren
might find an asylum. It will be noted that Benjamin seems to use
every effort to trace and to afford particulars of independent
communities of Jews, who had chiefs of their own, and owed no
allegiance to the foreigner.</p>

<p>He may have had trade and mercantile operations in view. He certainly
dwells on matters of commercial interest with considerable detail.
Probably he was actuated by both motives, coupled with the pious wish
of making a pilgrimage to the land of his fathers.</p>

<p>Whatever his intentions may have been, we owe Benjamin no small debt
of gratitude for handing to posterity records that form a unique
contribution to our knowledge of geography and ethnology in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<br />
<h4><a name="III_BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="III_BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>III. BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h4>


<p>&quot;The Itinerary of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela,&quot; prepared and published by
A. Asher, is the best edition of the diary of that traveller. The
first volume appeared in 1840, and contained a carefully compiled
Hebrew text with vowel points, together with an English translation
and a bibliographical account. A second volume appeared in 1841
containing elaborate notes by Asher himself and by such eminent
scholars as Zunz and Rapoport, together with a valuable essay by the
former on the Geographical Literature of the Jews and on the Geography
of Palestine, also an Essay by Lebrecht on the Caliphate of Bagdad.</p>

<p>In addition to twenty-three several reprints and translations
enumerated by Asher, various others have since appeared from time to
time, but all of them are based upon the two editions of the text from
which he compiled his work. These were the Editio Princeps, printed by
Eliezer ben Gershon at Constantinople, 1543, and the Ferrara Edition
of 1556, printed by Abraham Usque, the editor of the famous &quot;Jews&quot;
Bible in Spanish.</p>

<p>Asher himself more than once deplores the fact that he had not a
single MS. to resort to when confronted by doubtful or divergent
readings in the texts before him.</p>

<p>I have, however, been fortunate enough to be able to trace and examine
three complete MSS. of Benjamin's Travels, as well as large fragments
belonging to two other MSS., and these I have embodied in my present
collation. The following is a brief description of the MSS.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. BM, a MS. in the British Museum (No. 27,089). It is bound up with
some of Maimonides' works, several Midrashic tracts, a commentary on
the Hagadah by Joseph Gikatilia, and an extract from Abarbanel's
commentary on Isaiah; it forms part of the Almanzi collection, which
curiously enough was purchased by the British Museum from Asher &amp; Co.
in October, 1865, some twenty years after Asher's death.</p>

<p>Photographs of three pages of this MS. will be found with the Hebrew
text. With regard to the date of the MS., some competent judges who
have seen it assign it to the thirteenth century, and this view has
some support from Professor S. D. Luzzatto, who, in Steinschneider's
<i>Hammazkir</i> (vol. V, fo. 105, xvii) makes the following comment upon
it:&mdash;</p>

<p><img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image01.gif" width="322" height="17"></p>
<p>This MS. is the groundwork of the text I have adopted.</p>

<p>2. R, or the Roman MS., in the Casanatense library at Rome, and
numbered No. 216 in the Catalogue Sacerdote. This MS. occupies the
first twenty-seven leaves of Codex 3097, which contains fifteen other
treatises, among them a text of Eldad Hadani, all written by the same
scribe, Isaac of Pisa, in 5189 A.M., which corresponds with 1429-1430
(see Colophon at the end of the Hebrew text, page
<img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image02.gif" width="17" height="17">).
Under my direction Dr. Gr&uuml;nhut, of Jerusalem, proceeded to Rome, and
made a copy. Subsequently I obtained a collation of it made by the
late Dr. Neubauer; both have been used in preparing the notes to the
text. Later on, after the Hebrew text had already been printed, I
visited Rome, and on examining the MS. I found that a few variants had
been overlooked. I had facsimiles made of several pages, which will be
found with the Hebrew text.</p>

<p>3. E, a MS. now in the possession of Herr Epstein of
Vienna, who acquired it from Halberstamm's collection. The only
reliable clue as to the date of this MS. is the license of the censor:
&quot;visto per me fra Luigi da Bologna Juglio 1599.&quot; Herr Epstein
considers it to have been written at the end of the fifteenth or
beginning of the sixteenth century. The MS. is on paper and in
&quot;Italian&quot; handwriting. It contains seventy-four quarto pages of from
19-20 lines each. Speaking generally it is analogous to the edition of
Ferrara, 1556, which was used by Ashor as the groundwork of his text
(Asher, p. 3), but the spelling of persons and places in E often
differs from that in the text of Asher.</p>

<p>4. O, in the Oppenheim collection of the Bodleian Library (MS. Opp.
add. 8&deg; 36; ff. 58-63; Neubauer 2425), is a fragment. Its first three
leaves are continuous, beginning at p. 61 of Asher's edition and
ending at p. 73. After this there is a <i>lacuna</i> of four leaves, and
the fragment, which recommences at p. 98 of Asher's edition, is then
continuous to the end of the book. The volume in which it is bound
contains various other treatises written by the same scribe, and
includes a fragment on Maimonides, whose death is mentioned as
occurring in 1202, and also part of a controversy of Nachmanides which
took place in 1263.</p>

<p>The MS. is in Spanish Rabbinic characters, and would appear to have
been written in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. For the collation
of this and the following fragment I am indebted to the kindness of my
friend Mr. A. Cowley, of Oxford. Photographs of pages of both MSS.
will be found with the Hebrew text.</p>

<p>5. B, also in the Oppenheim collection of the Bodleian Library (MS.
Opp. add. 8&deg;, 58; fol. 57; Neubauer 2580). This fragment begins at p.
50 of Asher's edition. The date of this fragment is probably much
later than that of O, and may well be as late as the eighteenth
century. It appears to be written in an oriental hand.</p>

<p>In addition to the critical text, I give a translation of the British
Museum MS., and add brief notes thereto. I have purposely confined the
latter to small dimensions in view of the fact that Asher's notes, the
Jewish Encyclopaedia, and the works of such writers as Graetz and
others, will enable the reader to acquire further information on the
various incidents, personages, and places referred to by Benjamin. I
would, however, especially mention a work by Mr. C. Raymond Beazley
entitled &quot;The Dawn of Modern Geography,&quot; particularly his second
volume, published in 1901. The frank and friendly manner in which the
writer does justice to the merits of the Jewish traveller contrasts
favourably with the petty and malignant comments of certain non-Jewish
commentators, of which Asher repeatedly complains.</p>

<p>It is not out of place to mention that soon after the publication in
1841 of the work on Benjamin by A. Asher, there appeared a review
thereof in consecutive numbers of the Jewish periodical <i>Der Orient</i>.
The articles bore the signature <i>Sider</i>, but the author proved to be
Dr. Steinschneider. They were among the first literary contributions
by which he became known. Although written sixty-five years ago his
review has a freshness and a value which renders it well worth reading
at the present day. The ninetieth birthday of the Nestor of Semitic
literature was celebrated on March 30 of last year, and it afforded no
little gratification to the writer that Dr. Steinschneider on that
occasion accepted the dedication to him of this the latest
contribution to the &quot;Benjamin Literature.&quot; The savant passed away on
the 23rd of January last, and I humbly dedicate my modest work to his
memory.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of expressing my thanks to the editors of the
<i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, who have permitted me to reprint my
articles; also to Dr. Berlin and other friends for their co-operation;
and to the Delegates of the Oxford University Press for allowing me to
make use of the map of Western Asia in the twelfth century, which was
designed by Professor S. Lane-Poole.</p>

<p>HEBREW INTRODUCTION.</p>


<p>THIS is the book of travels, which was compiled by Rabbi Benjamin, the
son of Jonah, of the land of Navarre&mdash;his repose be in Paradise.</p>

<p>The said Rabbi Benjamin set forth from Tudela, his native city, and
passed through many remote countries, as is related in his book. In
every place which he entered, he made a record of all that he saw, or
was told of by trustworthy persons&mdash;matters not previously heard of in
the land of Sepharad<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Also he mentions some of the sages and
illustrious men residing in each place. He brought this book with him
on his return to the country of Castile, in the year 4933 (C.E.
1173)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The said Rabbi Benjamin is a wise and understanding man,<a name="bpage_2"></a>
learned in the Law and the Halacha, and wherever we have tested his
statements we have found them accurate, true to fact and consistent;
for he is a trustworthy man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_1" id="page_1">p.1</a></span>  His book commences as follows:&mdash;I journeyed first from my native
town to the city of Saragossa<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, and thence by way of the River Ebro
to Tortosa. From there I went a journey of two days to the ancient
city of Tarragona with its Cyclopean and Greek buildings<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The like
thereof is not found among any of the buildings in the country of
Sepharad. It is situated by the sea, and two days' journey from the
city of Barcelona, where there is a holy congregation, including
sages, wise and illustrious men, such as R. Shesheth<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, R. Shealtiel,
R. Solomon, and R. Abraham, son of Chisdai. This is a small city and
beautiful, lying upon the sea-coast. Merchants come thither from all
quarters with their wares, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">p.2</a></span> from Greece, from Pisa, Genoa,
Sicily, Alexandria in Egypt, Palestine, Africa and all its coasts.
Thence it is a day and a half to Gerona, in which there is a small
congregation of Jews<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. A three days'journey takes one to Narbonne,
which is a city pre-eminent for learning; thence the Torah (Law) goes
forth to all countries. Sages, and great and illustrious men abide
here. At their head is R. Kalonymos, the son of the great and
illustrious R. Todros of the seed of David, whose pedigree is
established. He possesses hereditaments and lands given him by the
ruler of the city, of which no man can forcibly dispossess him<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
Prominent in the community is <a name="bpage_3"></a>R Abraham<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, head of the Academy: also
R. Machir and R. Judah, and many other distinguished scholars. At the
present day 300 Jews are there.</p>

<p>Thence it is four parasangs<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to the city of Beziers, where there is
a congregation of learned men. At their head is R. Solomon Chalafta, R
Joseph, and R. Nethanel. Thence it is two days to Har Gaash which is
called Montpellier. This is a place well situated for commerce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">p.3</a></span>
It is about a parasang from the sea, and men come for business there
from all quarters, from Edom, Ishmael, the land of Algarve<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,
Lombardy, the dominion of Rome the Great, from all the land of Egypt,
Palestine, Greece, France, Asia and England. People of all nations are
found there doing business through the medium of the Genoese and
Pisans. In the city there are scholars of great eminence, at their
head being R. Reuben, son of Todros, R. Nathan, son of Zechariah, and
R. Samuel, their chief rabbi, also R. Solomon and R. Mordecai. They
have among them houses of learning devoted to the study of the Talmud.
Among the community are men both rich and charitable, who lend a
helping hand to all that come to them.</p>

<p>From Montpellier it is four parasangs to Lunel, in which there is a
congregation of Israelites, who study the Law day and night. Here
lived Rabbenu Meshullam the great rabbi, since deceased, and his five
sons, who are wise, great and wealthy, namely: R. Joseph, R. Isaac, R.
Jacob, R. Aaron, and R. Asher, the recluse, who dwells apart from the
world; he pores over his books day and night, fasts periodically and
abstains from all meat<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">p.4</a></span> He is a great scholar of the
Talmud. At Lunel live also their brother-in-law R. Moses, the chief
rabbi, R. Samuel the elder<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, R. Ulsarnu, R. Solomon Hacohen, and R.
Judah the Physician, the son of Tibbon, the Sephardi. The students
that come from distant lands to learn the Law are taught, boarded,
lodged and clothed by the congregation, so long as they attend the
house of study. The community has wise, understanding and saintly men
of great benevolence, who lend a helping hand to all their brethren<a name="bpage_4"></a>
both far and near. The congregation consists of about 300 Jews&mdash;may
the Lord preserve them.</p>

<p>From there it is two parasangs to Posqui&egrave;res, which is a large place
containing about forty Jews, with an Academy under the auspices of the
great Rabbi, R. Abraham, son of David, of blessed memory, an energetic
and wise man, great as a talmudical authority<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. People come to him
from a distance to learn the Law at his lips, and they find rest in
his house, and he teaches them. Of those who are without means he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">p.5</a></span> also pays the expenses, for he is very rich. The munificent R.
Joseph, son of Menachem, also dwells here, and R. Benveniste, R.
Benjamin, R. Abraham and R. Isaac, son of R. Meir of blessed memory.
Thence it is four parasangs to the suburb (Ghetto?) Bourg de St.
Gilles, in which place there are about a hundred Jews. Wise men abide
there; at their head being R. Isaac, son of Jacob, R. Abraham, son of
Judah, R. Eleazar, R. Jacob, R. Isaac, R. Moses and R. Jacob, son of
rabbi Levi of blessed memory. This is a place of pilgrimage of the
Gentiles who come hither from the ends of the earth. It is only three
miles from the sea, and is situated upon the great River Rhone, which
flows through the whole land of Provence. Here dwells the illustrious
R. Abba Mari, son of the late R. Isaac; he is the bailiff of Count
Raymond<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence it is three parasangs to the city of Arles, which has about 200
Israelites, at their head being R. Moses, R. Tobias, R. Isaiah, R.
Solomon, the chief rabbi R. Nathan, and R. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">p.6</a></span>Abba Mari, since
deceased<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>From there it is two days' journey to Marseilles<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, which is a city
of princely and wise citizens, possessing two congregations with about
300 Jews. One congregation dwells below on the shore by the sea, the
other is in the castle above. <a name="bpage_5"></a>They form a great academy of learned
men, amongst them being R. Simeon, R. Solomon, R. Isaac, son of Abba
Mari<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, R. Simeon, son of Antoli, and R. Jacob his brother; also R.
Libero. These persons are at the head of the upper academy. At the
head of the congregation below are R. Jacob Purpis<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, a wealthy man,
and R. Abraham, son of R. Meir, his son-in-law, and R. Isaac, son of
the late R. Meir. It is a very busy city upon the sea-coast.</p>

<p>From Marseilles one can take ship and in four days reach Genoa, which
is also upon the sea. Here live two Jews, R. Samuel, son of Salim, and
his brother, from the city of Ceuta, both of them good men. The city
is surrounded by a wall, and the inhabitants are not governed by any
king, but by judges whom they appoint at their pleasure. Each <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">p.7</a></span>householder has a tower to his house, and at times of strife they
fight from the tops of the towers with each other. They have command
of the sea. They build ships which they call galleys, and make
predatory attacks upon Edom and Ishmael<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the land of Greece as
far as Sicily, and they bring back to Genoa spoils from all these
places. They are constantly at war with the men of Pisa. Between them
and the Pisans there is a distance of two days' journey.</p>

<p>Pisa is a very great city, with about 10,000 turreted houses for
battle at times of strife. All its inhabitants are mighty men. They
possess neither king nor prince to govern them, but only the judges
appointed by themselves. In this city are about twenty Jews, at their
head being R. Moses, R. Chayim, and R. Joseph. The city is not
surrounded by a wall. It is about six miles from the sea; the river
which flows through the city provides it with ingress and egress for
ships.</p>

<p>From Pisa it is four parasangs to the city of Lucca, which is the
beginning of the frontier of Lombardy. In the city of Lucca are about
forty Jews. It is a large place, and at the head of the Jews are R.
David, R. Samuel, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">p.8</a></span> R. Jacob.</p>

<p>Thence it is six days' journey to the great city of Rome. Rome is the
head of the kingdoms of Christendom, and contains about 200 Jews, who
occupy an honourable position and pay no tribute, and amongst them are
officials of the Pope Alexander, the spiritual head of all
Christendom. Great scholars reside here, at the head of them being R.
Daniel, the chief rabbi, and R. Jechiel, an <a name="bpage_6"></a>official of the Pope<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.
He is a handsome young man of intelligence and wisdom, and he has the
entry of the Pope's palace; for he is the steward of his house and of
all that he has. He is a grandson of R. Nathan, who composed the
Aruch<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and its commentaries. Other scholars are R. Joab, son of the
chief rabbi R. Solomon, R. Menachem, head of the academy, R. Jechiel,
who lives in Trastevere, and R. Benjamin, son of R. Shabbethai of
blessed memory. Rome is divided into two parts by the River Tiber. In
the one part is the great church which they call St. Peter's of Rome.
The great Palace of Julius Caesar was also in Rome<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>There are many wonderful structures in the city, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">p.9</a></span>different from
any others in the world. Including both its inhabited and ruined
parts, Rome is about twenty-four miles in circumference. In the midst
thereof<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> there are eighty palaces belonging to eighty kings who
lived there, each called Imperator, commencing from King Tarquinius
down to Nero and Tiberius, who lived at the time of Jesus the
Nazarene, ending with Pepin, who freed the land of Sepharad from
Islam, and was father of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>There is a palace outside Rome (said to be of Titus). The Consul and
his 300 Senators treated him with disfavour, because he failed to take
Jerusalem till after three years, though they had bidden him to
capture it within two<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>In Rome is also the palace of Vespasianus, a great and very strong
building; also the Colosseum<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, in which edifice there are 365
sections, <a name="bpage_7"></a>according to the days of the solar year; and the
circumference of these palaces is three miles. There were battles
fought here in olden times, and in the palace more than 100,000 men
were slain, and there their bones remain piled up to the present day.
The king caused to be engraved a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">p.10</a></span>representation of the battle
and of the forces on either side facing one another, both warriors and
horses, all in marble, to exhibit to the world the war of the days of
old.</p>

<p>In Rome there is a cave which runs underground, and catacombs of King
Tarmal Galsin and his royal consort who are to be found there, seated
upon their thrones, and with them about a hundred royal personages.
They are all embalmed and preserved to this day. In the church of St.
John in the Lateran there are two bronze columns taken from the
Temple, the handiwork of King Solomon, each column being engraved
&quot;Solomon the son of David.&quot; The Jews of Rome told me that every year
upon the 9th of Ab they found the columns exuding moisture like water.
There also is the cave where Titus the son of Vespasianus stored the
Temple vessels which he brought from Jerusalem. There is also a cave
in a hill on one bank of the River Tiber where are the graves of the
ten martyrs<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. In front of St. John in the Lateran there are
statues of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">p.11</a></span> Samson in marble, with a spear in his hand, and of Absalom
the son of King David, and another of Constantinus the Great, who
built Constantinople and after whom it was called. The last-named
statue is of bronze, the horse being overlaid with gold<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Many
other edifices are there, and remarkable sights beyond enumeration.</p>

<p>From Rome it is four days to Capua, the large town which King Capys
built. It is a fine city, but its water is bad, and the country is
fever-stricken<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. About 300 Jews live there, among them great
scholars and esteemed persons, at their heads being R. Conso, his
brother R. Israel, R. Zaken and the chief rabbi R. David, since
deceased. They call this district the Principality.</p>
<a name="bpage_8"></a>
<p>From there one goes to Pozzuoli which is called Sorrento the Great,
built by Zur, son of Hadadezer, when he fled in fear of David the
king. The sea has risen and covered the city from its two sides, and
at the present day one can still see the markets and towers which
stood in the midst of the city<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. A spring issues forth from beneath
the ground containing the oil which is called petroleum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">p.12</a></span>
People collect it from the surface of the water and use it
medicinally. There are also hot-water springs to the number of about
twenty, which issue from the ground and are situated near the sea, and
every man who has any disease can go and bathe in them and get cured.
All the afflicted of Lombardy visit it in the summer-time for that
purpose.</p>

<p>From this place a man can travel fifteen miles along a road under the
mountains, a work executed by King Romulus who built the city of Rome.
He was prompted to this by fear of King David and Joab his
general<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. He built fortifications both upon the mountains and below
the mountains reaching as far as the city of Naples. Naples is a very
strong city, lying upon the sea-board, and was founded by the Greeks.
About 500 Jews live here, amongst them R. Hezekiah, R. Shallum, R.
Elijah Hacohen and R. Isaac of Har Napus, the chief rabbi of blessed
memory.</p>

<p>Thence one proceeds by sea to the city of Salerno, where the
Christians have a school of medicine. About 600 Jews dwell there.
Among the scholars are R. Judah, son of R. Isaac, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">p.13</a></span>
Melchizedek, the great Rabbi<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, who came from the city of Siponto;
also R. Solomon (the Cohen), R. Elijah the Greek, R. Abraham Narboni,
and R. Hamon. It is a city with walls upon the land side, the other
side bordering on <a name="bpage_9"></a>the sea and there is a very strong castle on the
summit of the hill. Thence it is half a day's journey to Amalfi, where
there are about twenty Jews, amongst them R. Hananel, the physician,
R. Elisha, and Abu-al-gir, the prince. The inhabitants of the place
are merchants engaged in trade, who do not sow or reap, because they
dwell upon high hills and lofty crags, but buy everything for money.
Nevertheless, they have an abundance of fruit, for it is a land of
vineyards and olives, of gardens and plantations, and no one can go to
war with them.</p>

<p>Thence it is a day's journey to Benevento, which is a city situated
between the sea-coast and a mountain, and possessing a community of
about 200 Jews. At their head are R. Kalonymus, R. Zarach, and R.
Abraham. From there it is two days' journey to Melfi in the country of
Apulia, which is the land of Pul<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, where about 200<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">p.14</a></span> Jews
reside, at their head being R. Achimaaz, R. Nathan, and R. Isaac. From
Melfi it is about a day's journey to Ascoli, where there are about
forty Jews, at their head being R. Consoli, R. Zemach, his son-in-law,
and R. Joseph. From there it takes two days to Trani on the sea, where
all the pilgrims gather to go to Jerusalem; for the port is a
convenient one. A community of about 200 Israelites is there, at their
head being R. Elijah, R. Nathan, the expounder, and R. Jacob. It is a
great and beautiful city.</p>

<p>From there it is a day's journey to Colo di Bari, which is the great
city which King William of Sicily destroyed<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Neither Jews nor
Gentiles live there at the present day in consequence of its
destruction. Thence it is a day and a half to Taranto, which is under
the government of Calabria, the inhabitants of which are Greek<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. It
is a large city, and contains about 300 Jews, some of them men of
learning, and at their head are R. Meir, R. Nathan, and R. Israel.</p>

<p>From Taranto it is a day's journey to Brindisi, which is on the sea
coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">p.15</a></span> About ten Jews, who are dyers, reside here. It is two
days' journey to Otranto, which is on the coast of the Greek sea. Here
are about 50 Jews, at the head of them being R. Menachem, R. Caleb,<a name="bpage_10"></a>
R. Meir, and R. Mali. From Otranto it is a voyage of two days to
Corfu, where only one Jew of the name of R. Joseph lives, and here
ends the kingdom of Sicily.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days' voyage to the land of Larta (Arta), which is
the beginning of the dominions of Emanuel, Sovereign of the Greeks. It
is a place containing about 100 Jews, at their head being R.
Shelachiah and R. Hercules. From there it is two days to Aphilon
(Achelous)<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, a place in which reside about thirty Jews, at their
head being R. Sabbattai. From there it takes half a day to Anatolica,
which is situated on an arm of the sea
<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>
<p>From there it takes a day to Patras, which is the city which
Antipater<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, King of the Greeks, built. He was one of the four
successors of King Alexander. In the city there are several large old
buildings, and about fifty <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16"
id="page_16">p.16</a></span>Jews live here, at their head being
R. Isaac, R. Jacob, and R. Samuel. Half a day's journey by way of the
sea takes one to Kifto (Lepanto)<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, where there are about 100 Jews,
who live on the sea-coast; at their head are R. Guri, R. Shallum, and
R. Abraham. From there it is a journey of a day and a half to Crissa,
where about 200 Jews live apart. They sow and reap on their own land;
at their head are R. Solomon, R. Chayim, and R. Jedaiah. From there it
is three days' journey to the capital city of Corinth; here are about
300 Jews, at their head being R. Leon, R. Jacob, and R. Hezekiah.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days' journey to the great city of Thebes, where
there are about 2,000 Jews. They are the most skilled artificers in
silk and purple cloth throughout Greece. They have scholars learned in
the Mishnah and the Talmud, and other prominent men, and at their head
are the chief rabbi R. Kuti and his brother R. Moses, as well as R.
Chiyah, R. Elijah Tirutot, and R. Joktan; and there are none like them
in the land of the Greeks, except in the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">p.17</a></span>
Constantinople. From Thebes it is a day's journey to Egripo<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, which
is a large city upon the sea-coast, where merchants come from every
quarter. About 200 Jews live there, at their head being R. Elijah
Psalteri, R. Emanuel, and R. Caleb.</p>

<p>From there it takes a day to Jabustrisa, which is a city upon the
sea-coast with about 100 Jews, at their head being R. Joseph,<a name="bpage_11"></a>
R. Elazar, R. Isaac, R. Samuel, and R. Nethaniah. From there it is a
day's journey to Rabonica, where there are about 100 Jews, at their
head being R. Joseph, R. Elazar, and R. Isaac.</p>

<p>From there it is a day's journey to Sinon Potamo, where there are
about fifty Jews, at their head being R. Solomon and R. Jacob. The
city is situated at the foot of the hills of Wallachia. The nation
called Wallachians live in those mountains. They are as swift as
hinds, and they sweep down from the mountains to despoil and ravage
the land of Greece. No man can go up and do battle against them, and
no king can rule over them. They do not hold fast to the faith of the
Nazarenes, but give themselves Jewish names. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">p.18</a></span> Some people say
that they are Jews, and, in fact, they call the Jews their brethren,
and when they meet with them, though they rob them, they refrain from
killing them as they kill the Greeks. They are altogether lawless<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>From there it is two days' journey to Gardiki, which is in ruins and
contains but a few Greeks and Jews. From there it is two days' journey
to Armylo, which is a large city on the sea, inhabited by Venetians,
Pisans, Genoese, and all the merchants who come there; it is an
extensive place, and contains about 400 Jews. At their head are the
chief rabbi R. Shiloh Lombardo, R. Joseph, the warden, and R. Solomon,
the leading man. Thence it is a day's journey to Vissena, where there
are about 100 Jews, at their head being the chief rabbi R. Sabbattai,
R. Solomon, and R. Jacob.</p>

<p>From there it is two days' voyage to the city of Salonica, built by
King Seleucus, one of the four successors who followed after King
Alexander. It is a very large city, with about 500 Jews, including the
chief rabbi R. Samuel and his sons, who are scholars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">p.19</a></span>   He is
appointed by the king as head of the Jews. There is also R. Sabbattai,
his son-in-law, R. Elijah, and R. Michael. The Jews are oppressed, and
live by silk-weaving.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days' journey to Demetrizi, with about fifty Jews. In
this place live R. Isaiah, R. Machir, and R. Alib. Thence it is two
days to Drama, where there are about 140 Jews, at the head of them
being R. Michael and R. Joseph. From there it is one day's journey to
Christopoli, where about twenty Jews live.</p>

<p>A three days' voyage brings one to Abydos, which is upon an arm of the
sea which flows between the mountains, and after a five days' journey
the great town of Constantinople is reached. It is the capital of the
whole land of Javan, which is called Greece. Here is the residence of<a name="bpage_12"></a>
the King Emanuel the Emperor. Twelve ministers are under him, each of
whom has a palace in Constantinople and possesses castles and cities;
they rule all the land. At their head is the King Hipparchus, the
second in command is the Megas Domesticus, the third Dominus, and the
fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">p.20</a></span>  is Megaa Ducas, and the fifth is Oeconomus Megalus; the
others bear names like these<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. The circumference of the city of
Constantinople is eighteen miles; half of it is surrounded by the sea,
and half by land, and it is situated upon two arms of the sea, one
coming from the sea of Russia, and one from the sea of Sepharad.</p>

<p>All sorts of merchants come here from the land of Babylon, from the
land of Shinar, from Persia, Media, and all the sovereignty of the
land of Egypt, from the land of Canaan, and the empire of Russia<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>,
from Hungaria, Patzinakia<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, Khazaria<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, and the land of Lombardy
and Sepharad. It is a busy city, and merchants come to it from every
country by sea or land, and there is none like it in the world except
Bagdad, the great city of Islam. In Constantinople is the church of
Santa Sophia, and the seat of the Pope of the Greeks, since the Greeks
do not obey the Pope of Rome. There are also churches according to the
number of the days of the year. A quantity of wealth beyond telling is
brought hither year by year as tribute from the two islands and the
castles and villages which are there. And the like of this wealth is
not to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">p.21</a></span>   in any other church in the world. And in this
church there are pillars of gold and silver, and lamps of silver and
gold more than a man can count. Close to the walls of the palace is
also a place of amusement belonging to the king, which is called the
Hippodrome, and every year on the anniversary of the birth of Jesus
the king gives a great entertainment there. And in that place men from
all the races of the world come before the king and queen with<a name="bpage_13"></a>
jugglery and without jugglery, and they introduce lions, leopards,
bears, and wild asses, and they engage them in combat with one
another; and the same thing is done with birds. No entertainment like
this is to be found in any other land.</p>

<p>This King Emanuel built a great palace for the seat of his Government
upon the sea-coast, in addition to the palaces which his fathers
built, and he called its name Blachernae<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. He overlaid its columns
and walls with gold and silver, and engraved thereon representations
of the battles before his day and of his own combats. He also set up a
throne of gold and of precious stones, and a golden crown was
suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">p.22</a></span>   by a gold chain over the throne, so arranged that he
might sit thereunder<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. It was inlaid with jewels of priceless
value, and at night time no lights were required, for every one could
see by the light which the stones gave forth. Countless other
buildings are to be met with in the city. From every part of the
empire of Greece tribute is brought here every year, and they fill
strongholds with garments of silk, purple, and gold. Like unto these
storehouses and this wealth, there is nothing in the whole world to be
found. It is said that the tribute of the city amounts every year to
20,000 gold pieces, derived both from the rents of shops and markets,
and from the tribute of merchants who enter by sea or land.</p>

<p>The Greek inhabitants are very rich in gold and precious stones, and
they go clothed in garments of silk with gold embroidery, and they
ride horses, and look like princes. Indeed, the land is very rich in
all cloth stuffs, and in bread, meat, and wine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">p.23</a></span>   Wealth like
that of Constantinople is not to be found in the whole world. Here
also are men learned in all the books of the Greeks, and they eat and
drink every man under his vine and his fig-tree.</p>

<p>They hire from amongst all nations warriors called Loazim (Barbarians)
to fight with the Sultan Masud<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, King of the Togarmim (Seljuks),
who are called Turks; for the natives are not warlike, but are as
women who have no strength to fight.</p>

<a name="bpage_14"></a>
<p>No Jews live in the city, for they have been placed behind an inlet of
the sea. An arm of the sea of Marmora shuts them in on the one side,
and they are unable to go out except by way of the sea, when they want
to do business with the inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. In the Jewish quarter are
about 2,000 Rabbanite Jews and about 500 Kara&iuml;tes, and a fence divides
them. Amongst the scholars are several wise men, at their head being
the chief rabbi R. Abtalion, R. Obadiah, R. Aaron Bechor Shoro, R.
Joseph Shir-Guru, and R. Eliakim, the warden. And amongst them there
are artificers in silk and many rich merchants. No Jew there is
allowed to ride on horseback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24"
id="page_24">p.24</a></span>   The one exception is R. Solomon
Hamitsri, who is the king's physician, and through whom the Jews enjoy
considerable alleviation of their oppression. For their condition is
very low, and there is much hatred against them, which is fostered by
the tanners, who throw out their dirty water in the streets before the
doors of the Jewish houses and defile the Jews' quarter (the Ghetto).
So the Greeks hate the Jews, good and bad alike, and subject them to
great oppression, and beat them in the streets, and in every way treat
them with rigour. Yet the Jews are rich and good, kindly and
charitable, and bear their lot with cheerfulness. The district
inhabited by the Jews is called Pera.</p>

<p>From Constantinople it is two days' voyage to Rhaedestus<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, with a
community of Israelites of about 400, at their head being R. Moses, R.
Abijah, and R. Jacob. From there it is two days to Callipolis
(Gallipoli), where there are about 200 Jews, at their head being R.
Elijah Kapur, R. Shabbattai Zutro, and R. Isaac Megas, which means
&quot;great&quot; in Greek. And from here it is two days to Kales.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">p.25</a></span>Here
there are about fifty Jews, at their head being R. Jacob and R. Judah.
From here it is two days' journey to the island of Mytilene, and there
are Jewish congregations in ten localities on the island. Thence it is
three days' voyage to the island of Chios, where there are about 400
Jews, including R. Elijah Heman and R. Shabtha. Here grow the trees
from which mastic is obtained. Two days' voyage takes one to the
island of Samos, where there are 300 Jews, at their head being R.
Shemaria, R. Obadiah, and R. Joel. The islands have many congregations
of Jews. From Samos it is three days to Rhodes, where there are about
400 Jews, at their head being R. Abba, R. Hannanel, and R. Elijah. It
is four days' voyage from here to Cyprus, where there are Rabbanite<a name="bpage_15"></a>
Jews and Kara&iuml;tes; there are also some heretical Jews called
Epikursin, whom the Israelites have excommunicated in all places. They
profane the eve of the sabbath, and observe the first night of the
week, which is the termination of the sabbath<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. From Cyprus it is
four days' journey to Curicus (Kurch), which is the beginning of the
land <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">p.26</a></span>  called Armenia, and this is the frontier of the empire of
Thoros<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, ruler of the mountains, and king of Armenia, whose
dominions extend to the province of Trunia<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, and to the country of
the Togarmim or Turks. From there it is two days' journey to
Malmistras, which is Tarshish, situated by the sea; and thus far
extends the kingdom of the Javanim or Greeks<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days' journey to Antioch the Great, situated on the
river Fur (Orontes), which is the river Jabbok, that flows from Mount
Lebanon and from the land of Hamath<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. This is the great city which<a name="bpage_16"></a>
Antiochus the king built. The city lies by a lofty mountain, which is
surrounded by the city-wall. At the top of the mountain is a well,
from which a man appointed for that purpose directs the water by means
of twenty subterranean passages to the houses of the great men of the
city. The other part of the city is surrounded by the river. It is a
strongly fortified city, and is under the sway of Prince Boemond
Poitevin<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, surnamed le Baube. Ten Jews<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> dwell here, engaged in
glass-making, and at their head are R. Mordecai, R. Chayim, and R.
Samuel. From here it is two days' journey to Lega, or Ladikiya, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">p.27</a></span>  there are about 100 Jews, at their head being R. Chayim and R.
Joseph.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days' journey to Gebal (Gebela), which is Baal-Gad,
at the foot of Lebanon<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. In the neighbourhood dwells a people
called Al-Hashishim<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. They do not believe in the religion of Islam,
but follow one of their own folk, whom they regard as their prophet,<a name="bpage_17"></a>
and all that he tells them to do they carry out, whether for death or
life. They call him the Sheik Al Hashishim, and he is known as their
Elder. At his word these mountaineers go out and come in. Their
principal seat is Kadmus, which is Kedemoth in the land of Sihon. They
are faithful to each other, but a source of terror to their
neighbours, killing even kings at the cost of their own lives. The
extent of their land is eight days' journey. And they are at war with
the sons of Edom who are called the Franks, and with the ruler of
Tripolis, which is Tarabulus el Sham<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. At Tripolis in years gone by
there was an earthquake, when many Gentiles and Jews perished, for
houses and walls fell upon them. There was great destruction at that
time throughout <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">p.28</a></span> the Land of Israel, and more than 20,000 souls
perished<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence it is a day's journey to the other Gebal (Gubail), which
borders on the land of the children of Ammon, and here there are about
150 Jews. The place is under the rule of the Genoese, the name of the
governor being Guillelmus Embriacus<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. Here was found a temple
belonging to the children of Ammon in olden times, and an idol of
theirs seated upon a throne or chair, and made of stone overlaid with
gold. Two women are represented sitting one on the right and one on
the left of it, and there is an altar in front before which the
Ammonites used to sacrifice and burn incense<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. There are about 200<a name="bpage_18"></a>
Jews there, at their head being R. Meir, R. Jacob, and R. Simchah. The
place is situated on the sea-border of the land of Israel. From there
it is two days' journey to Beirut, or Beeroth, where there are about
fifty Jews, at their head being R. Solomon, R. Obadiah, and R. Joseph.
Thence it is one day's journey to Saida, which is Sidon, a large city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">p.29</a></span>  with about twenty Jews. Ten miles therefrom a people dwell who
are at war with the men of Sidon; they are called Druses, and are
pagans of a lawless character. They inhabit the mountains and the
clefts of the rocks; they have no king or ruler, but dwell independent
in these high places, and their border extends to Mount Hermon, which
is a three days' journey. They are steeped in vice, brothers marrying
their sisters, and fathers their daughters. They have one feast-day in
the year, when they all collect, both men and women, to eat and drink
together, and they then interchange their wives<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. They say that at
the time when the soul leaves the body it passes in the case of a good
man into the body of a newborn child, and in the case of a bad man
into the body of a dog or an ass. Such are their foolish beliefs.
There are no resident Jews among them, but a certain number of Jewish
handicraftsmen and dyers come among them for the sake of trade, and
then return, the people being favourable to the Jews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">p.30</a></span>  They
roam over the mountains and hills, and no man can do battle with them.</p>

<p>From Sidon it is half a day's journey to Sarepta (Sarfend), which
belongs to Sidon. Thence it is a half-day to New Tyre (S&#363;r), which
is a very fine city, with a harbour in its midst. At night-time those
that levy dues throw iron chains from tower to tower, so that no man
can go forth by boat or in any other way to rob the ships by night.
There is no harbour like this in the whole world. Tyre is a beautiful
city. It contains about 500 Jews, some of them scholars of the Talmud,
at their head being R. Ephraim of Tyre, the Dayan, R. Meir from
Carcassonne, and R. Abraham, head of the congregation. The Jews own
sea-going vessels, and there are glass-makers amongst them who make
that fine Tyrian glass-ware which is prized in all countries.</p>
<a name="bpage_19"></a>
<p>In the vicinity is found sugar of a high class, for men plant it here,
and people come from all lands to buy it<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. A man can ascend the
walls of New Tyre and see ancient Tyre, which the sea has now covered,
lying at a stone's throw from the new city. And should one care to go
forth by boat, one can see the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31"
id="page_31">p.31</a></span> castles, market-places, streets,
and palaces in the bed of the sea. New Tyre is a busy place of
commerce, to which merchants flock from all quarters.</p>

<p>One day's journey brings one to Acre, the Acco of old, which is on the
borders of Asher; it is the commencement of the land of Israel.
Situated by the Great Sea, it possesses a large harbour for all the
pilgrims who come to Jerusalem by ship. A stream runs in front of it,
called the brook of Kedumim<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. About 200 Jews live there, at their
head being R. Zadok, R. Japheth, and R. Jonah. From there it is three
parasangs to Haifa, which is Hahepher<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> on the seaboard, and on the
other side is Mount Carmel<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, at the foot of which there are many
Jewish graves. On the mountain is the cave of Elijah, where the
Christians have erected a structure called St. Elias. On the top of
the mountain can be recognized the overthrown altar which Elijah
repaired in the days of Ahab. The site of the altar is circular, about
four cubits remain thereof, and at the foot of the mountain the brook
Kishon flows. From here it is four parasangs to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">p.32</a></span> Capernaum,
which is the village of Nahum, identical with Maon, the home of Nabal
the Carmelite<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_20"></a>
<p>Six parasangs from here is Caesarea, the Gath<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> of the Philistines,
and here there are about 200 Jews and 200 Cuthim. These are the Jews
of Shomron, who are called Samaritans. The city is fair and beautiful,
and lies by the sea. It was built by Caesar, and called after him
Caesarea. Thence it is half a day's journey to Kako<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, the Keilah of
Scripture. There are no Jews here. Thence it is half a day's journey
to St. George, which is Ludd<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, where there lives one Jew, who is a
dyer. Thence it is a day's journey to Sebastiya, which is the city of
Shomron (Samaria), and here the ruins of the palace of Ahab the son of
Omri may be seen. It was formerly a well-fortified city by the
mountain-side, with streams of water. It is still a land of brooks of
water, gardens, orchards, vineyards, and olive groves, but no Jews
dwell here. Thence it is two parasangs to Nablous, which is Shechem on
Mount Ephraim, where there are no Jews; the place is situated in the
valley between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, and contains about 1,000
Cuthim, who observe the written law of Moses alone, and are called
Samaritans. They have priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">p.33</a></span>  of the seed (of Aaron), and they
call them Aaronim, who do not intermarry with Cuthim, but wed only
amongst themselves<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. These priests offer sacrifices, and bring
burnt-offerings in their place of assembly on Mount Gerizim, as it is
written in their law&mdash;&quot;And thou shalt set the blessing on Mount
Gerizim.&quot; They say that this is the proper site of the Temple. On
Passover and the other festivals they offer up burnt-offerings on the
altar which they have built on Mount Gerizim, as it is written in
their law&mdash;&quot;Ye shall set up the stones upon Mount Gerizim, of the<a name="bpage_21"></a>
stones which Joshua and the children of Israel set up at the Jordan.&quot;
They say that they are descended from the tribe of Ephraim. And in the
midst of them is the grave of Joseph, the son of Jacob our father, as
it is written&mdash;&quot;and the bones of Joseph buried they in Shechem<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.&quot;
Their alphabet lacks three letters, namely <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image03.gif" width="194" height="17"> <a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. The letter <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image04.gif" width="14" height="15"> He is taken from
Abraham our father, because they have no dignity, the letter <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image05.gif" width="18" height="16">
Heth from Isaac, because they have no kindliness, and the letter
<img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image06.gif" width="22" height="18"> Ain from Jacob, because they have no humility. In place of
these letters they make use of the Aleph, by which we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">p.34</a></span>  tell
that they are not of the seed of Israel, although they know the law of
Moses with the exception of these three letters. They guard themselves
from the defilement of the dead, of the bones of the slain, and of
graves; and they remove the garments which they have worn before they
go to the place of worship, and they bathe and put on fresh clothes.
This is their constant practice. On Mount Gerizim are fountains and
gardens and plantations, but Mount Ebal is rocky and barren; and
between them in the valley lies the city of Shechem.</p>

<p>From the latter place it is a distance of four parasangs to Mount
Gilboa, which the Christians call Mont Gilboa; it lies in a very
parched district. And from there it is five<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> ..., a village where
there are no Jews. Thence it is two parasangs to the valley of
Ajalon<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, which the Christians call Val-de-Luna. At a distance of<a name="bpage_22"></a>
one parasang is Mahomerie-le-Grand, which is Gibeon the Great; it
contains no Jews.</p>

<p>From there it is three parasangs to Jerusalem, which is a small city,
fortified by three walls. It is full of people whom the Mohammedans
call Jacobites, Syrians, Greeks, Georgians and Franks, and of people
of all tongues. It contains a dyeing-house, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">p.35</a></span> for which the Jews
pay a small rent annually to the king<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, on condition that besides
the Jews no other dyers be allowed in Jerusalem. There are about 200
Jews who dwell under the Tower of David in one corner of the city<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.
The lower portion of the wall of the Tower of David, to the extent of
about ten cubits, is part of the ancient foundation set up by our
ancestors, the remaining portion having been built by the Mohammedans.
There is no structure in the whole city stronger than the Tower of
David. The city also contains two buildings, from one of which&mdash;the
hospital&mdash;there issue forth four hundred knights; and therein all the
sick who come thither are lodged and cared for in life and in
death<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. The other building is called the Temple of Solomon; it is
the palace built by Solomon the king of Israel. Three hundred knights
are quartered there, and issue therefrom every day for military
exercise, besides those who come from the land of the Franks and the
other parts of Christendom, having taken upon themselves to serve
there a year or two until their vow is fulfilled. In Jerusalem is the
great church called the Sepulchre, and here is the burial-place of
Jesus, unto which the Christians make pilgrimages.[<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">p.36</a></span> </p>

<p>Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> has four gates&mdash;the gate of Abraham, the gate of David,
the gate of Zion, and the gate of Gushpat, which is the gate of
Jehoshaphat, facing our ancient Temple, now called Templum Domini.<a name="bpage_23"></a>
Upon the site of the sanctuary Omar ben al Khataab erected an edifice
with a very large and magnificent cupola, into which the Gentiles do
not bring any image or effigy, but they merely come there to pray. In
front of this place is the western wall, which is one of the walls of
the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and thither come
all the Jews to pray before the wall of the court of the Temple. In
Jerusalem, attached to the palace which belonged to Solomon, are the
stables built by him, forming a very substantial structure, composed
of large stones, and the like of it is not to be seen anywhere in the
world. There is also visible up to this day the pool used by the
priests before offering their sacrifices, and the Jews coming thither
write their names upon the wall. The gate of Jehoshaphat leads to the
valley of Jehoshaphat, which is the gathering-place of nations<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.
Here is the pillar called <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">p.37</a></span>  Absalom's Hand, and the sepulchre of
King Uzziah<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood is also a great spring, called the Waters of
Siloam, connected with the brook of Kidron. Over the spring is a large
structure dating from the time of our ancestors, but little water is
found, and the people of Jerusalem for the most part drink the
rain-water, which they collect in cisterns in their houses. From the
valley of Jehoshaphat one ascends the Mount of Olives; it is the
valley only which separates Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. From
the Mount of Olives one sees the Sea of Sodom, and at a distance of
two parasangs from the Sea of Sodom is the Pillar of Salt into which
Lot's wife was turned; the sheep lick it continually, but afterwards
it regains its original shape<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. The whole land of the plain and the<a name="bpage_24"></a>
valley of Shittim as far as Mount Nebo are visible from here.</p>

<p>In front of Jerusalem is Mount Zion, on which there is no building,
except a place of worship belonging to the Christians. Facing
Jerusalem for a distance of three miles are the cemeteries<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
belonging to the Israelites, who in the days of old buried their dead
in caves, and upon each sepulchre is a dated inscription, but the
Christians destroy the sepulchres, employing the stones thereof in
building their houses. These sepulchres reach as far as Zelzah in the
territory of Benjamin. Around Jerusalem are high mountains.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">p.38</a></span>

<p>On Mount Zion are the sepulchres of the House of
David, and the sepulchres of the kings that ruled after him. The exact
place cannot be identified, inasmuch as fifteen years ago a wall of
the church of Mount Zion fell in. The Patriarch commanded the overseer
to take the stones of the old walls and restore therewith the church.
He did so, and hired workmen at fixed wages; and there were twenty men
who brought the stones from the base of the wall of Zion. Among these
men there were two who were sworn friends. On a certain day the one
entertained the other; after their meal they returned to their work,
when the overseer said to them, &quot;Why have you tarried to-day?&quot; They
answered, &quot;Why need you complain? When our fellow workmen go to their
meal we will do our work.&quot; When the dinner-time arrived, and the other
workmen had gone to their meal, they examined the stones, and raised a
certain stone which formed the entrance to a cave. Thereupon one said
to the other, &quot;Let us go in and see if any money is to be found
there.&quot; They entered the cave, and reached a large chamber resting
upon pillars of marble overlaid with silver and gold. In
front was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">p.39</a></span> a table of gold and a sceptre and crown. This was the
sepulchre of King David. On the left thereof in like fashion was the
sepulchre of King Solomon; then followed the sepulchres of all the
kings of Judah that were buried there. Closed coffers were also there,
the contents of which no man knows. The two men essayed to enter the
chamber, when a fierce wind came forth from the entrance of the cave
and smote them, and they fell to the ground like dead men, and there
they lay until evening. And there came forth a wind like a man's
voice, crying out: &quot;Arise and go forth from this place!&quot; So the men
rushed forth in terror, and they came unto the Patriarch, and related
these things to him. Thereupon the Patriarch sent for Rabbi Abraham el
Constantini, the pious recluse, who was one of the mourners of
Jerusalem, and to him he related all these things according to the<a name="bpage_25"></a>
report of the two men who had come forth. Then Rabbi Abraham replied,
&quot;These are the sepulchres of the House of David; they belong to the
kings of Judah, and on the morrow let us enter. I and you and these
men, and find out what is there.&quot; And on the morrow they sent
for the two men, and found each of them lying on his bed  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">p.40</a></span>in terror,
and the men said: &quot;We will not enter there, for the Lord doth not
desire to show it to any man.&quot; Then the Patriarch gave orders that the
place should be closed up and hidden from the sight of man unto this
day. These things were told me by the said Rabbi Abraham.</p>

<p>From Jerusalem it is two parasangs to Bethlehem, which is called by
the Christians Beth-Leon, and close thereto, at a distance of about
half a mile, at the parting of the way, is the pillar of Rachel's
grave, which is made up of eleven stones, corresponding with the
number of the sons of Jacob. Upon it is a cupola resting on four
columns, and all the Jews that pass by carve their names upon the
stones of the pillar<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. At Bethlehem there are two Jewish dyers. It
is a land of brooks of water, and contains wells and fountains.</p>

<p>At a distance of six parasangs is St. Abram de Bron, which is Hebron;
the old city stood on the mountain, but is now in ruins; and in the
valley by the field of Machpelah lies the present city. Here
there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish
place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">p.41</a></span>but the Gentiles
have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and
Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the
pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which
information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and
gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a
gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is
able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in
his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and
a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third
cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah. And upon
the graves are inscriptions cut in stone; upon the grave of Abraham is
engraved &quot;This is the grave of Abraham&quot;; upon that of Isaac, &quot;This is
the grave of Isaac, the son of Abraham our Father&quot;; upon that of
Jacob, &quot;This is the grave of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of
Abraham our Father&quot;; and upon the others, &quot;This is the grave of
Sarah,&quot; &quot;This is the grave of Rebekah,&quot; and &quot;This is the grave of
Leah.&quot; A lamp burns day and night upon the graves in the cave.</p>
<a name="bpage_26"></a>
<p>One finds there many casks filled with the bones of Israelites, as the
members of the house of Israel were wont to bring the bones of their
fathers thither and to deposit them there to this day<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. </p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">p.42</a></span>

<p>Beyond the field of Machpelah is the house of Abraham; there is a well
in front of the house, but out of reverence for the Patriarch Abraham
no one is allowed to build in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>From Hebron it is five parasangs to Beit Jibrin, which is Mareshah,
where there are but three Jews<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. Three parasangs further one
reaches St. Samuel of Shiloh. This is the Shiloh which is two
parasangs from Jerusalem. When the Christians captured Ramlah, the
Ramah of old, from the Mohammedans, they found there the grave of
Samuel the Ramathite close to a Jewish synagogue. The Christians took
the remains, conveyed them unto Shiloh, and erected over them a large
church, and called it St. Samuel of Shiloh unto this day<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_27"></a>
<p>From there it is three parasangs to Mahomerie-le-petit<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, which is
Gibeah of Saul, where there are no Jews, and this is Gibeah of
Benjamin. Thence three parasangs to Beit Nuba<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, which is Nob, the
city of priests. In the middle <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">p.43</a></span>of the way are the two crags of
Jonathan, the name of the one being Bozez, and the name of the other
Seneh<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. Two Jewish dyers dwell there.</p>

<p>Thence it is three parasangs to Rams, or Ramleh, where there are
remains of the walls from the days of our ancestors, for thus it was
found written upon the stones. About 300 Jews dwell there. It was
formerly a very great city; at a distance of two miles there is a
large Jewish cemetery<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence it is five parasangs to Y&#257;fa or Jaffa, which is on the
seaboard, and one Jewish dyer lives here. From here it is five
parasangs to Ibelin or Jabneh, the seat of the Academy, but there are
no Jews there at this day. Thus far extends the territory of Ephraim.</p>

<p>From there it is five parasangs to Palmid, which is Ashdod of the
Philistines, now in ruins; no Jews dwell there. Thence it is two
parasangs to Ashkelonah or New Askelon, which Ezra the priest <a name="bpage_28"></a>
built by the sea. It was originally called Bene Berak. The place is
four parasangs distant from the ancient ruined city of Askelon. New
Askelon is a large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">p.44</a></span> fair place, and merchants come thither from all
quarters, for it is situated on the frontier of Egypt. About 200
Rabbanite Jews dwell here, at their head being R. Zemach, R. Aaron,
and R. Solomon; also about forty Kara&iuml;tes, and about 300 Cuthim. In
the midst of the city there is a well, which they call Bir Abraham;
this the Patriarch dug in the days of the Philistines<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>From there it is a journey of a day to St. George<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of Ludd: thence
it is a day and a half to Zerin or Jezreel, where there is a large
spring. One Jewish dyer lives here. Three parasangs further is
Saffuriya or Sepphoris. Here are the graves of Rabbenu Hakkadosh, of
Rabban Gamaliel, and of R. Chiya, who came up from Babylon, also of
Jonah the son of Amittai; they are all buried in the mountain<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.
Many other Jewish graves are here.</p>

<p>Thence it is five parasangs to Tiberias, which is situated
upon the Jordan, which is here called the Sea of Chinnereth. The
Jordan at this place flows through a valley between two mountains, and
fills the lake, which is called the Lake of Chinnereth; this is a
large and broad piece of water like the sea. The Jordan flows between
two mountains, and over the plain which is the place that is called
Ashdoth Hapisgah, and thence continues its course till it falls into
the Sea of Sodom, which is the Salt Sea. In Tiberias there are about
fifty Jews, at their head being <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">p.45 </a></span> R. Abraham the astronomer, R. Muchtar,
and R. Isaac. There are hot waters here, which bubble up from the
ground, and are called the Hot Waters of Tiberias. Near by is the
Synagogue of Caleb ben Jephunneh, and Jewish sepulchres. R. Johanan<a name="bpage_29"></a>
ben Zakkai and R. Jehudah Halevi<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> are buried here. All these places
are situated in Lower Galilee.</p>

<p>From here it is two days to Tymin or Timnathah, where Simon
the Just<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and many Israelites are buried, and thence three
parasangs to Medon or Meron. In the neighbourhood there is a cave in
which are the sepulchres of Hillel and Shammai. Here also are twenty
sepulchres of disciples, including the sepulchres of R. Benjamin ben
Japheth, and of R. Jehudah ben Bethera. From Meron it is two parasangs
to Almah, where there are about fifty Jews. There is a large Jewish
cemetery here, with the sepulchres of R. Eleazar ben Arak, of R.
Eleazar ben Azariah, of Chuni Hamaagal, of Raban Simeon ben <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">p.46</a></span>Gamaliel,
and of R. Jose Hagelili<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. </p>

<p>From here it is half a day's journey to Kades, or Kedesh Naphtali,
upon the Jordan. Here is the sepulchre of Barak the son of Abinoam. No
Jews dwell here.</p>

<p>Thence it is a day's journey to Banias, which is Dan, where there is a
cavern, from which the Jordan issues and flows for a distance of three
miles, when the Arnon, which comes from the borders of Moab, joins
it<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. In front of the cavern may be discerned the site of the altar
associated with the graven image of Micah, which the children of Dan
worshipped in ancient days. This is also the site of the altar of
Jeroboam, where the golden calf was set up. Thus far reaches the
boundary of the land of Israel towards the uttermost sea<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.</p>

<p>Two days' journey brings one to Damascus, the great city,
which is the commencement of the empire of Nur-ed-din, the king of the
Togarmim, called Turks. It is a fair city of large extent, surrounded
by walls, with many gardens and plantations, extending over fifteen
miles on each side, and no district richer in fruit can be seen in all
the world. From Mount Hermon descend the rivers Amana and Pharpar; for
the city is situated at the foot of Mount Hermon. The Amana flows
through the city, and by means of aqueducts the water is conveyed to
the houses of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">p.47</a></span>the great people, and into the streets and
market-places. The Pharpar flows through their gardens and<a name="bpage_30"></a>
plantations. It is a place carrying on trade with all countries. Here
is a mosque of the Arabs called the Gami of Damascus; there is no
building like it in the whole world, and they say that it was a palace
of Ben Hadad. Here is a wall of crystal glass of magic workmanship,
with apertures according to the days of the year, and as the sun's
rays enter each of them in daily succession the hours of the day can
be told by a graduated dial. In the palace are chambers built of gold
and glass, and if people walk round the wall they are able to see one
another, although the wall is between them. And there are columns
overlaid with gold and silver, and columns of marble of all
colours<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. And in the court there is a gigantic head overlaid with
gold and silver, and fashioned like a bowl with rims of gold and
silver. It is as big as a cask, and three men can enter therein at the
same time to bathe. In the palace is suspended the rib of one of the
giants, the length being nine cubits, and the width two cubits; and
they say it belonged to the King Anak of the giants of old, whose name
was Abramaz<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.  For so it was found inscribed on his grave,
where it was also written that he ruled <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">p.48</a></span>over the whole world. Three
thousand Jews abide in this city, and amongst them are learned and
rich men<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. The head of the Academy of the land of Israel resides
here<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. His name is R. Azariah, and with him are his brother, Sar
Shalom, the head of the Beth Din: R. Joseph, the fifth of the Academy:
R. Mazliach, the lecturer, the head of the order: R. Meir, the crown
of the scholars: R. Joseph ben Al Pilath, the pillar of the Academy:
R. Heman, the warden: and R. Zedekiah, the physician. One hundred
Kara&iuml;tes dwell here, also 400 Cuthim, and there is peace between them,
but they do not intermarry.</p>

<p>It is a day's journey to Galid, which is Gilead, and sixty Israelites
are there, at their head being R. Zadok, R. Isaac, and R. Solomon. It
is a place of wide extent, with brooks of water, gardens, and
plantations. Thence it is half a day to Salkat, which is Salchah of
old<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_31"></a>
<p>Thence it is half a day's journey to Baalbec, which is Baalath
in the plains of Lebanon, and which Solomon built for the daughter of
Pharaoh. The palace is built of large stones, each stone having a
length of twenty cubits and a width of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">p.49</a></span>twelve cubits, and there are no
spaces between the stones. It is said that Ashmedai alone could have
put up this building. From the upper part of the city a great spring
wells forth and flows into the middle of the city as a wide stream,
and alongside thereof are mills and gardens and plantations in the
midst of the city. At Tarmod (Tadmor) in the wilderness, which Solomon
built, there are similar structures of huge stones.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The city of
Tarmod is surrounded by walls; it is in the desert far away from
inhabited places, and is four days' journey from Baalath, just
mentioned. And in Tarmod there are about 2,000 Jews. They are valiant
in war and fight with the Christians and with the Arabs, which latter
are under the dominion of Nur-ed-din the king, and they help their
neighbours the Ishmaelites. At their head are R. Isaac Hajvani, R.
Nathan, and R. Uziel.</p>

<p>From Baalbec to Karjat&#298;n, which 1s Kirjathim, is a distance of half
a day; no Jews live there except one dyer. Thence it is a day's
journey to Emesa, which is a city of the Zemarites, where about twenty
Jews dwell<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. Thence it is a day's journey to Hamah, which is
Hamath. It lies on the river Jabbok at the foot of Mount Lebanon<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.
Some time ago there was a great earthquake in the city, and<a name="bpage_32"></a>
25,000 souls perished in one day, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50"
id="page_50">p.50</a></span>of about 200 Jews but seventy
escaped. At their head are R. Eli Hacohen, and the Sheik Abu Galib and
Mukhtar. Thence it is half a day to Sheizar, which is Hazor<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, and
from there it is three parasangs to Dimin (Latmin).</p>

<p> Thence it is two days to Haleb (Aleppo) or Aram Zoba, which is
the royal city of Nur-ed-din. In the midst of the city is his palace
surrounded by a very high wall. This is a very large place. There is
no well there nor any stream, but the inhabitants drink rainwater,
each one possessing a cistern in his house<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. The city has 5,000
Jewish inhabitants, at their head being R. Moses el Constantini and R.
Seth. Thence it is two days to Balis<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, which is Pethor on the
river Euphrates, and unto this day there stands the turret of Balaam,
which he built to tell the hours of the day. About ten Jews live here.
Thence it is half a day to Kalat Jabar, which is Selah of the
wilderness, that was left unto the Arabs at the time the Togarmim took
their land and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">p.51</a></span>caused them to fly into the wilderness. About 2,000
Jews dwell there, at their head being R. Zedekiah, R. Chiya, and R.
Solomon.</p>

<p>Thence it is one day's journey to Rakka<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>, or Salchah, which is on
the confines of the land of Shinar, and which divides the land of the
Togarmim from that kingdom. In it there are 700 Jews, at their head
being R. Zakkai and R. Nedib, who is blind, and R. Joseph. There is a
synagogue here, erected by Ezra when he went forth from Babylon to
Jerusalem. At two days' distance lies ancient Harr&#257;n, where twenty<a name="bpage_33"></a>
Jews live<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. Here is another synagogue erected by Ezra, and in this
place stood the house of Terah and Abraham his son. The ground is not
covered by any building, and the Mohammedans honour the site and come
thither to pray.</p>

<p>Thence it is a journey of two days to Ras-el-Ain<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, whence proceeds
the river El Khabur&mdash;the Habor of old&mdash;which flows through the land of
Media, and falls into the river Gozan<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. Here there are 200
Jews<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. Thence it is two days to Geziret Ibn Omar, which is
surrounded by the river <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52"
id="page_52">p.52</a></span>Hiddekel (Tigris), at the foot of the
mountains of Ararat. </p>

<p>It is a distance of four miles to the place where Noah's Ark rested,
but Omar ben al Khataab took the ark from the two mountains and made
it into a mosque for the Mohammedans<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Near the ark is the
Synagogue of Ezra to this day, and on the ninth of Ab the Jews come
thither from the city to pray. In the city of Geziret Omar are 4,000
Jews, at their head being R. Mubchar, R. Joseph and R. Chiya.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days to Mosul, which is Assur the Great, and here
dwell about 7,000 Jews, at their head being R. Zakkai the Nasi of the
seed of David, and R. Joseph surnamed Burhan-al-mulk, the astronomer
to the King Sin-ed-din, the brother of Nur-ed-din, King of
Damascus<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. Mosul is the frontier town of the land of Persia.</p>
<a name="bpage_34"></a>
<p>It is a very large and ancient city, situated on the river
Hiddekel (Tigris), and is connected with Nineveh by means of a bridge.
Nineveh is in ruins, but amid the ruins there are villages and
hamlets, and the extent of the city may be determined by the walls,
which extend forty parasangs to the city of Irbil<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">p.53</a></span>The city of
Nineveh is on the river Hiddekel. In the city of Assur (Mosul) is the
synagogue of Obadiah, built by Jonah; also the synagogue of Nahum the
Elkoshite<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence it is a distance of three days to Rahbah, which is on the river
Euphrates. Here there are about 2,000 Jews, at their head being R.
Hezekiah, R. Tahor and R. Isaac. It is a very fine city, large and
fortified, and surrounded by gardens and plantations.</p>

<p>Thence it is a day's journey to Karkisiya which is Carchemish, on the
river Euphrates. Here there are about 500 Jews, at their head being R.
Isaac and R. Elhanan. Thence it is two days to El-Anbar which is
Pumbedita in Nehardea<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Here reside 3,000 Jews, and amongst them
are learned men, at their head being the chief rabbi R. Chen, R. Moses
and R. Jehoiakim. Here are the graves of Rab Jehuda and Samuel, and in
front of the graves of each of them are the synagogues which they<a name="bpage_35"></a>
built in their lifetime. Here is also the grave of Bostanai the Nasi,
the head of the Captivity, and of R. Nathan and Rab Nachman the son of
Papa.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">p.54</a></span>

<p> Thence it takes five days to Hadara, where about 15,000 Jews
dwell, at their head being R. Zaken, R. Jehosef and R. Nethanel<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence it takes two days to Okbara, the city, which Jeconiah the King
built, where there are about 10,000 Jews, and at their head are R.
Chanan, R. Jabin and R. Ishmael.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days to Bagdad, the great city and the royal
residence of the Caliph Emir al Muminin al Abbasi of the family of
Mohammed. He is at the head of the Mohammedan religion, and all the
kings of Islam obey him; he occupies a similar position to that held
by the Pope over the Christians<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. He has a palace in Bagdad three
miles in extent, wherein is a great park with all varieties of trees,
fruit-bearing and otherwise, and all manner of animals. The whole is
surrounded by a wall, and in the park there is a lake whose waters are
fed by the river Hiddekel. Whenever the king desires to indulge in
recreation and to rejoice and feast, his servants catch all manner of'
birds, game and fish, and he goes to his palace with his counsellors
and princes. There the great king, Al Abbasi the Caliph
(Hafiz) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">p.55</a></span>holds his court, and he is kind unto Israel, and many
belonging to the people of Israel are his attendants; he knows all
languages, and is well versed in the law of Israel. He reads and
writes the holy language (Hebrew). He will not partake of anything<a name="bpage_36"></a>
unless he has earned it by the work of his own hands. He makes
coverlets to which he attaches his seal; his courtiers sell them in
the market, and the great ones of the land purchase them, and the
proceeds thereof provide his sustenance. He is truthful and trusty,
speaking peace to all men. The men of Islam see him but once in the
year. The pilgrims that come from distant lands to go unto Mecca which
is in the land El-Yemen, are anxious to see his face, and they
assemble before the palace exclaiming &quot;Our Lord, light of Islam and
glory of our Law, show us the effulgence of thy countenance,&quot; but he
pays no regard to their words. Then the princes who minister unto him
say to him, &quot;Our Lord, spread forth thy peace unto the men that have
come from distant lands, who crave to abide under the shadow of thy
graciousness,&quot; and thereupon he arises and lets down the hem of his
robe from the window, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">p.56</a></span>and the pilgrims come and kiss it<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>,
and a prince says unto them &quot;Go forth in peace, for our Master the
Lord of Islam granteth peace to you.&quot; He is regarded by them as
Mohammed and they go to their houses rejoicing at the salutation which
the prince has vouchsafed unto them, and glad at heart that they have
kissed his robe.</p>

<p>Each of his brothers and the members of his family has an abode in his
palace, but they are all fettered in chains of iron, and guards are
placed over each of their houses so that they may not rise against the
great Caliph. For once it happened to a predecessor that his brothers
rose up against him and proclaimed one of themselves as Caliph; then
it was decreed that all the members of his family should be bound,
that they might not rise up against the ruling Caliph. Each one of
them resides in his palace in great splendour, and they own villages
and towns, and their stewards bring them the tribute thereof, and they
eat and drink and rejoice all the days of their life<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. Within the
domains of the palace of the Caliph there are great buildings of
marble and columns of silver and gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">p. 57</a></span> carvings upon rare
stones are fixed in the walls. In the Caliph's palace are great riches<a name="bpage_37"></a>
and towers filled with gold, silken garments and all precious stones.
He does not issue forth from his palace save once in the year, at the
feast which the Mohammedans call El-id-bed Ramazan, and they come from
distant lands that day to see him. He rides on a mule and is attired
in the royal robes of gold and silver and fine linen; on his head is a
turban adorned with precious stones of priceless value, and over the
turban is a black shawl as a sign of his modesty, implying that all
this glory will be covered by darkness on the day of death. He is
accompanied by all the nobles of Islam dressed in fine garments and
riding on horses, the princes of Arabia, the princes of Togarma and
Daylam (Gil&#257;n) and the princes of Persia, Media and Ghuzz, and the
princes of the land of Tibet, which is three months' journey distant,
and westward of which lies the land of Samarkand. He proceeds from his
palace to the great mosque of Islam which is by the Basrah Gate. Along
the road the walls are adorned with silk and purple, and the
inhabitants receive him with all kinds of song and exultation, and
they dance before the great king who is styled the Caliph. They salute
him with a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">p.58</a></span> voice and say, &quot;Peace unto thee, our Lord the
King and Light of Islam!&quot; He kisses his robe, and stretching forth the
hem thereof he salutes them. Then he proceeds to the court of the
mosque, mounts a wooden pulpit and expounds to them their Law. Then
the learned ones of Islam arise and pray for him and extol his
greatness and his graciousness, to which they all respond. Afterwards
he gives them his blessing, and they bring before him a camel which he
slays, and this is their passover-sacrifice. He gives thereof unto the
princes and they distribute it to all, so that they may taste of the
sacrifice brought by their sacred king; and they all rejoice.
Afterwards he leaves the mosque and returns alone to his palace by way
of the river Hiddekel, and the grandees of Islam accompany him in
ships on the river until he enters his palace. He does not return the
way he came; and the road which he takes along the river-side is
watched all the year through, so that no man shall tread in his
footsteps. He does not leave the palace again for a whole year. He is
a benevolent man.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">p.59</a></span>

<p> He built, on the other side of the river, on the banks of an
arm of theEuphrates which there borders the city, a hospital
consisting of blocks of houses and hospices for the sick poor who come
to be healed<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. Here there are about sixty physicians' stores which<a name="bpage_38"></a>
are provided from the Caliph's house with drugs and whatever else may
be required. Every sick man who comes is maintained at the Caliph's
expense and is medically treated. Here is a building which is called
Dar-al-Maristan, where they keep charge of the demented people who
have become insane in the towns through the great heat in the summer,
and they chain each of them in iron chains until their reason becomes
restored to them in the winter-time. Whilst they abide there, they are
provided with food from the house of the Caliph, and when their reason
is restored they are dismissed and each one of them goes to his house
and his home. Money is given to those that have stayed in the hospices
on their return to their homes. Every month the officers of the Caliph
inquire and investigate whether they have regained their reason, in
which case they are discharged. All this the Caliph does out of
charity to those that come to the city of Bagdad, whether they be sick
or insane. The Caliph is a righteous man, and all his actions are for
good.</p>
<a name="bpage_39"></a>
<p>In Bagdad there are about 40,000 Jews<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">p.60</a></span> and they dwell in
security, prosperity and honour under the great Caliph, and amongst
them are great sages, the heads of Academies engaged in the study of
the law. In this city there are ten Academies. At the head of the
great Academy is the chief rabbi R. Samuel, the son of Eli. He is the
head of the Academy Gaon Jacob. He is a Levite, and traces his
pedigree back to Moses our teacher. The head of the second Academy is
R. Hanania his brother, warden of the Levites; R. Daniel is the head
of the third Academy; R. Elazar the scholar is the head of the fourth
Academy; and R. Elazar, the son of Zemach, is the head of the order,
and his pedigree reaches to Samuel the prophet, the Korahite. He and
his brethren know how to chant the melodies as did the singers at the
time when the Temple was standing. He is head of the fifth Academy. R.
Hisdai, the glory of the scholars, is head of the sixth Academy. R.
Haggai is head of the seventh Academy. R. Ezra is the head of the
eighth Academy. R. Abraham, who is called Abu Tahir, is the head of
the ninth Academy. R. Zakkai, the son of Bostanai the Nasi, is the
head of the Sium<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61"
id="page_61">p.61</a></span>These are the ten Batlanim<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>, and
they do not engage in any other work than communal administration; and
all the days of the week they judge the Jews their countrymen, except
on the second day of the week, when they all appear before the chief
rabbi Samuel, the head of the Yeshiba Gaon (Jacob), who in conjunction
with the other Batlanim judges all those that appear before him. And
at the head of them all is Daniel the son of Hisdai, who is styled
&quot;Our Lord the Head of the Captivity of all Israel.&quot; He possesses a
book of pedigrees going back as far as David, King of Israel. The Jews
call him &quot;Our Lord, Head of the Captivity,&quot; and the Mohammedans call
him &quot;Saidna ben Daoud,&quot; and he has been invested with authority over
all the congregations of Israel at the hands of the Emir al Muminin,
the Lord of Islam<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_40"></a>
<p>For thus Mohammed commanded concerning him and his descendants; and he
granted him a seal of office over all the congregations that dwell
under his rule, and ordered that every one, whether Mohammedan or Jew,
or belonging to any other nation in his dominion, should rise up
before him (the Exilarch) and salute him, and that any one who should
refuse to rise up should receive one hundred stripes<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">p.62</a></span>
<p>And every fifth day when he goes to pay a visit to the great
Caliph, horsemen, Gentiles as well as Jews, escort him, and heralds
proclaim in advance, &quot;Make way before our Lord, the son of David, as
is due unto him,&quot; the Arabic words being &quot;Amilu tarik la Saidna ben
Daud.&quot; He is mounted on a horse, and is attired in robes of silk and
embroidery with a large turban on his head, and from the turban is
suspended a long white cloth adorned with a chain upon which the
cipher of Mohammed is engraved. Then he appears before the Caliph and
kisses his hand, and the Caliph rises and places him on a throne which
Mohammed had ordered to be made for him, and all the Mohammedan
princes who attend the court of the Caliph rise up before him. And the
Head of the Captivity is seated on his throne opposite to the Caliph,
in compliance with the command of Mohammed to give effect to what is
written in the law&mdash;&quot;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a
law-giver from between his feet, until he come to Shiloh: and to him
shall the gathering of the people be.&quot; The authority of the Head of
the Captivity extends over all the communities of Shinar, Persia,
Khurasan and Sheba which is El-Yemen, and Diyar Kalach (Bekr) and the
land of Aram Naharaim (Mesopotamia), and over the dwellers in the
mountains of Ararat and the land of the Alans<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, which is a land<a name="bpage_41"></a>
surrounded by mountains and has no outlet except by the iron gates
which Alexander made, but which were afterwards broken. Here are the
people called Alani. His authority extends also over the land of
Siberia, and the communities in the land of the Togarmim unto the
mountains of Asveh and the land of Gurgan, the inhabitants of which
are called Gurganim who dwell by the river Gihon<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, and these are
the Girgashites who follow the Christian religion. Further it extends
to the gates of Samarkand, the land of Tibet, and the land of India.
In respect of all these countries the Head of the Captivity gives the
communities power to appoint <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63"
id="page_63">p.63</a></span>Rabbis and Ministers who come unto him to
be consecrated and to receive his authority. They bring him
offerings and gifts from the ends of the earth. He owns hospices,
gardens and plantations in Babylon, and much land inherited from his
fathers, and no one can take his possessions from him by force. He has
a fixed weekly revenue arising from the hospices of the Jews, the
markets and the merchants, apart from that which is brought to him
from far-off lands. The man is very rich, and wise in the Scriptures
as well as in the Talmud, and many Israelites dine at his table every
day.</p>

<p>At his installation, the Head of the Captivity gives much money to the
Caliph, to the Princes and the Ministers. On the day that the Caliph
performs the ceremony of investing him with authority, he rides in the
second of the royal equipages, and is escorted from the palace of the
Caliph to his own house with timbrels and fifes. The Exilarch appoints<a name="bpage_42"></a>
the Chiefs of the Academies by placing his hand upon their heads, thus
installing them in their office<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. The Jews of the city are learned
men and very rich.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">p.64</a></span>
<p> In Bagdad there are twenty-eight Jewish Synagogues, situated
either in the city itself or in Al-Karkh on the other side of the
Tigris; for the river divides the metropolis into two parts. The great
synagogue of the Head of the Captivity has columns of marble of
various colours overlaid with silver and gold, and on these columns
are sentences of the Psalms in golden letters. And in front of the ark
are about ten steps of marble; on the topmost step are the seats of
the Head of the Captivity and of the Princes of the House of David.
The city of Bagdad is twenty miles in circumference, situated in a
land of palms, gardens and plantations, the like of which is not to be
found in the whole land of Shinar. People come thither with
merchandise from all lands. Wise men live there, philosophers who know
all manner of wisdom, and magicians expert in all manner of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days to Gazigan which is called Resen. It is a large
city containing about 5,000 Jews. In the midst of it is the Synagogue
of Rabbah<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>&mdash;a large one. He is buried close to the Synagogue, and
beneath his sepulchre is a cave where twelve of his pupils are buried.</p>

<p>Thence it is a day's journey <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65"
id="page_65">p.65</a></span>to Babylon, which is the Babel of
old. The ruins thereof are thirty miles in extent<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. The ruins of
the palace of Nebuchadnezzar are still to be seen there, but people
are afraid to enter them on account of the serpents and scorpions.
Near at hand, within a distance of a mile, there dwell 3,000
Israelites who pray in the Synagogue of the Pavilion of Daniel, which<a name="bpage_43"></a>
is ancient and was erected by Daniel. It is built of hewn stones and
bricks. Between the Synagogue and the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar is the
furnace into which were thrown Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and the
site of it lies in a valley<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> known unto all.</p>

<p>Thence it is five parasangs to Hillah, where there are 10,000
Israelites and four Synagogues: that of R. Meir, who lies buried
before it; the Synagogue of Mar Keshisha, who is buried in front of
it; also the Synagogue of Rab Zeiri, the son of Chama, and the
Synagogue of R. Mari; the Jews pray there every day.</p>

<p>Thence it is four miles to the Tower of Babel, which the generation
whose language was confounded built of the bricks called Agur. The
length of its foundation is about two miles, the breadth of the tower
is about forty cubits, and the length thereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">p.66</a></span> two hundred
cubits. At every ten cubits' distance there are slopes which go round
the tower by which one can ascend to the top<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. One can see from
there a view twenty miles in extent, as the land is level. There fell
fire from heaven into the midst of the tower which split it to its
very depths.</p>

<p>Thence it is half a day to Kaphri, where there are about 200 Jews.
Here is the Synagogue of R. Isaac Napcha, who is buried in front of
it. Thence it is three parasangs to the Synagogue of Ezekiel, the
prophet of blessed memory, which is by the river Euphrates<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. It is
fronted by sixty turrets, <a name="bpage_44"></a>and between each turret there is a minor
Synagogue, and in the court of the Synagogue is the ark, and at the
back of the Synagogue is the sepulchre of Ezekiel. It is surmounted by
a large cupola, and it is a very handsome structure. It was built of
old by King Jeconiah, king of Judah, and the 35,000 Jews who came with
him, when Evil-merodach brought him forth out of prison. This place is
by the river Chebar on the one side, and by the river Euphrates on the
other, and the names of Jeconiah and those that accompanied him are
engraved on the wall: Jeconiah at the top, and Ezekiel <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">p.67</a></span>at the
bottom. This place is held sacred by Israel as a lesser sanctuary unto
this day, and people come from a distance to pray there from the time
of the New Year until the Day of Atonement. The Israelites have great
rejoicings on these occasions. Thither also come the Head of the
Captivity, and the Heads of the Academies from Bagdad. Their camp
occupies a space of about two miles, and Arab merchants come there as
well. A great gathering like a fair takes place, which is called Fera,
and they bring forth a scroll of the Law written on parchment by
Ezekiel the Prophet, and read from it on the Day of Atonement. A lamp
burns day and night over the sepulchre of Ezekiel; the light thereof
has been kept burning from the day that he lighted it himself, and
they continually renew the wick thereof, and replenish the oil unto
the present day. A large house belonging to the sanctuary is filled
with books, some of them from the time of the first temple, and some
from the time of the second temple, and he who has no sons consecrates
his books to its use. The Jews that come thither to pray from the land
of Persia and Media bring the money which their countrymen have
offered to the Synagogue of Ezekiel the Prophet. The Synagogue owns
property, lands and villages, which belonged to King Jeconiah, and
when Mohammed came he confirmed all these rights to the Synagogue of
Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. Distinguished Mohammedans also come hither <a name="bpage_45"></a>to pray, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">p.68</a></span>so great is their love for Ezekiel the Prophet; and they call it
Bar (Dar) Melicha (the Dwelling of Beauty). All the Arabs come there
to pray<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>At a distance of about half a mile from the Synagogue are the
sepulchres of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and upon their
sepulchres are large cupolas; and even at times of disturbance no man
would dare touch the Mohammedan or Jewish servants who attend at the
sepulchre of Ezekiel.</p>

<p>Thence it is three miles to the city of Kotsonath, where there are 300
Jews. Here are the sepulchres of Rab Papa, Rab Huna, Joseph Sinai, and
Rab Joseph ben Hama; and before each of them is a Synagogue where the
Israelites pray every day. Thence it is three parasangs to Ain Siptha,
where there is the sepulchre of the prophet Nahum the Elkoshite.
Thence it is a day's journey to Kefar Al-Keram, where are the
sepulchres of Rab Chisdai, R. Azariah, R. Akiba, and R. Dosa. Thence
it is a half-day's journey to a village in the desert, where there are
buried R. David and R. Jehuda and Abaji, R. Kurdiah, Rab Sechora, and
Rab Ada. Thence it is a day's journey to the river Raga, where <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">p.69</a></span>
there is the sepulchre of King Zedekiah. Upon it is a large cupola.
Thence it is a day's journey to the city of Kufa, where there is the
sepulchre of King Jeconiah. Over it is a big structure, and in front
thereof is a Synagogue. There are about 7,000 Jews here. At this place
is the large mosque of the Mohammedans, for here is buried Ali ben Abu
Talib, the son-in-law of Mohammed, and the Mohammedans come hither....</p>

<p>Thence it is a day and a half to Sura, which is Mata Mehasya, where
the Heads of the Captivity and the Heads of the Academies dwelt at
first<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. Here is the sepulchre of R. Sherira, and of R. Hai his son
of blessed memory, also of R. Saadiah Al-Fiumi, and of Rab Samuel the
son of Hofni Hacohen, and of Zephaniah <a name="bpage_46"></a>the son of Cushi the son of
Gedaliah, the prophet, and of the Princes of the House of David, and
of the Heads of the Academies who lived there before the destruction
of the town.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Thence it is two days to Shafjathib. Here is a Synagogue which the
Israelites built from the earth of Jerusalem and its stones, and they
called it Shafjathib, which is by Nehardea.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Thence it is a day and a half's journey to El-Anbar, which was
Pumbedita in Nehardea.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> About 3,000 Jews dwell there. The city
lies on the river Euphrates. Here is the Synagogue of Rab and Samuel,
and their house of study, and in front of it are their graves.</p>

<p>Thence it is five days to Hillah. From this place it is a journey of
twenty-one days by way of the deserts to the land of Saba, which is
called the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">p.70</a></span> El-Yemen, lying at the side of the land of
Shinar which is towards the North.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>
<a name="bpage_47"></a>
<p>Here dwell the Jews called Kheibar, the men of Teima. And Teima is
their seat of government where R. Hanan the Nasi rules over them. It
is a great city, and the extent of their land is sixteen days'
journey. It is surrounded by mountains&mdash;the mountains of the north.
The Jews own many large fortified cities. The yoke of the Gentiles is
hnot upon them. They go forth to pillage and to capture booty from
distant lands in conjunction with the Arabs, their neighbours and<a name="bpage_48"></a>
allies. These Arabs dwell in tents, and they make the desert their
home. They own no houses, and they go forth to pillage and to capture
booty in the land of Shinar and El-Yemen. All the neighbours of these
Jews go in fear of them. Among them are husbandmen and owners of
cattle; their land is extensive, and they have in their midst learned
and wise men. They give the tithe of all they possess unto the
scholars who sit in the house of learning, also to poor Israelites and
to the recluses, who are the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem, and who
do not eat meat nor taste wine, and sit clad in garments<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">p.71</a></span> of
black. They dwell in caves or underground houses, and fast each day
with the exception of the Sabbaths and Festivals, and implore mercy of
the Holy One, blessed be He, on account of the exile of Israel,
praying that He may take pity upon them, and upon all the Jews, the
men of Teima, for the sake of His great Name, also upon Tilmas the
great city, in which there are about 100,000 Jews<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. At this place
lives Salmon the Nasi, the brother of Hanan the Nasi; and the land
belongs to the two brothers, who are of the seed of David, for they
have their pedigree in writing. They address many questions unto the
Head of the Captivity&mdash;their kinsman in Bagdad&mdash;and they fast forty
days in the year for the Jews that dwell in exile.</p>

<p>There are here about forty large towns and 200 hamlets and villages.
The principal city is Tanai, and in all the districts together there
are about 300,000 Jews. The city of Tanai is well fortified, and in
the midst thereof the people sow and reap. It is fifteen miles in
extent. Here is the palace of the Nasi called Salmon. And in Teima
dwells Hanan the Nasi, his brother. It is a beautiful city, and
contains gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">p.72</a></span> and plantations. And Tilmas is likewise a
great city; it contains about 100,000 Jews. It is well fortified, and
is situated between two high mountains. There are wise, discreet, and
rich men amongst the inhabitants. From Tilmas to Kheibar it is three
days' journey. People say that the men of Kheibar belong to the tribes
of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, whom Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, led
hither into captivity. They have built strongly-fortified cities, and
make war upon all other kingdoms. No man can readily reach their
territory, because it is a march of eighteen days' journey through the
desert, which is altogether uninhabited, so that no one can enter the
land.</p>

<p>Kheibar is a very large city with 50,000 Jews<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. In it are learned<a name="bpage_49"></a>
men, and great warriors, who wage war with the men of Shinar and of
the land of the north, as well as with the bordering tribes of the<a name="bpage_50"></a>
land of El-Yemen near them, which latter country is on the confines of
India<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. Returning from their land, it is a journey of twenty-five
days to the river Virae, which is in the land of El-Yemen, <a name="bpage_51"></a>where about
3,000 Jews dwell<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73"
id="page_73">p.73</a></span>and amongst them are many a Rabbi and Dayan.</p>

<p>Thence it takes five days to Basra (Bassorah) which lies on the river
Tigris. Here there are 10,000 Jews, and among them are
scholars and many rich men. Thence it is two days to the river Samara,
which is the commencement of the land of Persia. 1,500 Jews live near
the sepulchre of Ezra, the priest, who went forth from Jerusalem to
King Artaxerxes and died here. In front of his sepulchre is a large
synagogue. And at the side thereof the Mohammedans erected a house of
prayer out of their great love and veneration for him, and they like
the Jews on that account. And the Mohammedans come hither to
pray<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. Thence it is four days to Khuzistan, which is Elam. This
province is not inhabited in its entirety, for part of it lies waste.
In the midst of its ruins is Shushan (Susa), the capital, the site of
the palace of King Ahasuerus. Here are the remains of a large
structure of great antiquity. The city contains about 7,000 Jews and
fourteen synagogues.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">p.74</a></span><a name="bpage_52"></a>
<p>In front of one of the synagogues is the sepulchre of Daniel
of blessed memory. The river Tigris divides the city, and the bridge
connects the two parts. On the one side where the Jews dwell is the
sepulchre of Daniel. Here the market-places used to be, containing
great stores of merchandise, by which the Jews became enriched. On the
other side of the bridge they were poor, because they had no
market-places nor merchants there, only gardens and plantations. And
they became jealous, and said &quot;All this prosperity enjoyed by those on
the other side is due to the merits of Daniel the prophet who lies
buried there.&quot; Then the poor people asked those who dwelt on the other
side to place the sepulchre of Daniel in their midst, but the others
would not comply. So war prevailed between them for many days, and no
one went forth or came in on account of the great strife between them.
At length both parties growing tired of this state of things took a
wise view of the matter, and made a compact, namely, that the coffin
of Daniel should be taken for one year to the one side and for another
year to the other side. This they did, and both sides became rich. In
the course of time Sinjar Shah-ben-Shah, who ruled over the kingdom of
Persia and had forty-five kings subject to his authority, came to this
place. </p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">p.75</a></span>

<p>He is called Sultan-al-Fars-al-Khabir in Arabic (the mighty Sovereign
of Persia), and it is he who ruled from the river Samara unto the city
of Samarkand, and unto the river Gozan and the cities of Media and the
mountains of Chafton<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. He ruled also over Tibet, in the forests
whereof one finds the animals from which the musk is obtained<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.
The extent of his Empire is a journey of four months. When this great
Emperor Sinjar, king of Persia, saw that they took the coffin of
Daniel from one side of the river to the other, and that a great
multitude of Jews, Mohammedans and Gentiles, and many people from the
country were crossing the bridge, he asked the meaning of this
proceeding, and they told him these things. He said, &quot;It is not meet
to do this ignominy unto Daniel the prophet, but I command you to
measure the bridge from both sides, and to take the coffin of Daniel
and place it inside another coffin of crystal, so that the wooden
coffin be within that of crystal, and to suspend this from the middle
of the bridge by a chain of iron; at this spot you must build a<a name="bpage_53"></a>
synagogue for all comers, so that whoever wishes to pray there, be he
Jew or Gentile, may do so.&quot; And to this very day the coffin is
suspended from the bridge. And the king commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">p.76</a></span> that out of
respect for Daniel no fisherman should catch fish within a mile above
or a mile below.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Thence it takes three days to Rudbar where there are about 20,000
Israelites, and among them are learned and rich men. But the Jews live
there under great oppression. Thence it is two days to Nihawand, where
there are 4,000 Israelites. Thence it is four days to the land of
Mulahid. Here live a people who do not profess the Mohammedan
religion, but live on high mountains, and worship the Old Man of the<a name="bpage_54"></a>
land of the Hashishim<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. And among them there are four communities
of Israel who go forth with them in war-time. They are not under the
rule of the king of Persia, but reside in the high mountains, and
descend from these mountains to pillage and to capture booty, and then
return to the mountains, and none can overcome them. There are learned
men amongst the Jews of their land. These Jews are under the authority
of the Head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">p.77</a></span> Captivity in Babylon. Thence it is five
days to Amadia where there are about 25,000 Israelites<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. This is
the first of those communities that dwell in the mountains of Chafton,
where there are more than 100 Jewish communities. Here is the
commencement of the land of Media. These Jews belong to the first
captivity which King Shalmanezar led away; and they speak the language
in which the Targum is written. Amongst them are learned men. The
communities reach from the province of Amadia unto the province of
Gilan, twenty-five days distant, on the border of the kingdom of
Persia. They are under the authority of the king of Persia, and he
raises a tribute from them through the hands of his officer, and the
tribute which they pay every year by way of poll tax is one gold amir,
which is equivalent to one and one-third maravedi. [This tax has to be
paid by all males in the land of Islam who are over the age of
fifteen.] At this place (Amadia), there arose this day ten years ago,
a man named David Alroy of the city of Amadia<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. He studied under
Chisdai the Head of the Captivity, and under the Head of the Academy
Gaon Jacob, in the city of Bagdad, and he was well versed in the Law
of Israel, in the Halachah, as well as in the Talmud, and in all the
wisdom of the Mohammedans, also in secular literature and in the<a name="bpage_55"></a>
writings of magicians and soothsayers. He conceived the idea of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">p.78</a></span> rebelling against the king of Persia, and of collecting the Jews
who live in the mountains of Chafton to go forth and to fight against
all the nations, and to march and capture Jerusalem. He showed signs
by pretended miracles to the Jews, and said, &quot;The Holy One, blessed be
He, sent me to capture Jerusalem and to free you from the yoke of the
Gentiles.&quot; And the Jews believed in him and called him their Messiah.
When the king of Persia heard of it he sent for him to come and speak
with him. Alroy went to him without fear, and when he had audience of
the king, the latter asked him, &quot;Art thou the king of the Jews?&quot; He
answered, &quot;I am.&quot; Then the king was wrath, and commanded that he
should be seized and placed in the prison of the king, the place where
the king's prisoners were bound unto the day of their death, in the
city of Tabaristan which is on the large river Gozan. At the end of
three days, whilst the king was sitting deliberating with his princes
concerning the Jews who had rebelled, David suddenly stood before
them. He had escaped from the prison without the knowledge of any man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">p.79</a></span>
And when the king  saw him, he said to him, &quot;Who brought thee
hither, and who has released thee?&quot; &quot;My own wisdom and skill,&quot;
answered the other; &quot;for I am not afraid of thee, nor of any of thy
servants.&quot; The king forthwith loudly bade his servants to seize him,
but they answered, &quot;We cannot see any man, although our ears hear
him.&quot; Then the king and all his princes marvelled at his subtlety; but
he said to the king &quot;I will go my way&quot;; so he went forth. And the king
went after him; and the princes and servants followed their king until
they came to the river-side. Then Alroy took off his mantle and spread
it on the face of the water to cross thereon. When the servants of the
king saw that he crossed the water on his mantle, they pursued him in
small boats, wishing to bring him back, but they were unable, and they
said, &quot;There is no wizard like this in the whole world.&quot; That
self-same day he went a journey of ten days to the city of Amadia by
the strength of the ineffable Name, and he told the Jews all that had
befallen him, and they were astonished at his wisdom.</p>

<p>After that the king of Persia sent word to the Emir Al-Muminin, the
Caliph of the Mohammedans at Bagdad, urging him to warn the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">p.80</a></span>
Head of the Exile, and the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, to restrain
David Alroy from executing his designs. And he threatened that he
would otherwise slay all the Jews in his Empire. Then all the
congregations of the land of Persia were in great trouble. And the
Head of the Captivity, and the Head of the Academy Gaon Jacob, sent to
Alroy, saying, &quot;The time of redemption is not yet arrived; we have not
yet seen the signs thereof; for by strength shall no man prevail. Now<a name="bpage_56"></a>
our mandate is, that thou cease from these designs, or thou shalt
surely be excommunicated from all Israel.&quot; And they sent unto Zakkai
the Nasi in the land of Assur (Mosul) and unto R. Joseph
Burhan-al-mulk the astronomer there, bidding them to send on the
letter to Alroy, and furthermore they themselves wrote to him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">p.81</a></span>warn him, but he would not accept the warning. Then there arose a
king of the name of Sin-ed-din, the king of the Togarmim, and a vassal
of the king of Persia, who sent to the father-in-law of David Alroy,
and gave him a bribe of 10,000 gold pieces to slay Alroy in
secret<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. So he went to Alroy's house, and slew him whilst he was
asleep on his bed. Thus were his plans frustrated. Then the king of
Persia went forth against the Jews that lived in the mountain; and
they sent to the Head of the Captivity to come to their assistance and
to appease the king. He was eventually appeased by a gift of 100
talents of gold, which they gave him, and the land was at peace
thereafter<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_57"></a>
<p>From this mountain it is a journey of twenty days to Hamadan, which is
the great city of Media, where there are 30,000 Israelites. In front
of a certain synagogue, there are buried Mordecai an Esther<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">p.82</a></span>
<p>From thence (Hamadan<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>) it takes four days to Tabaristan,<a name="bpage_58"></a>
which is situated on the river Gozan. Some [four] thousand Jews live
there<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. Thence it is seven days to Ispahan the great city and the
royal residence. It is twelve miles in circumference, and about 15,000
Israelites reside there<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. The Chief Rabbi is Sar Shalom, who has
been appointed by the Head of the Captivity to have jurisdiction over
all the Rabbis that are in the kingdom of Persia. Four days onward is
Shiraz, which is the city of Fars, and 10,000 Jews live there<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.
Thence it is seven days to Ghaznah the great city on the river Gozan,
where there are about 80,000 Israelites<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. It is a city of
commercial importance; people of all countries and tongues come<a name="bpage_59"></a>
thither with their wares. The land is extensive.</p>

<p>Thence it is five days to Samarkand, which is the great city on the
confines of Persia. In it live some 50,000 Israelites, and R. Obadiah
the Nasi is their appointed head. Among them are wise and very rich
men.</p>

<p>Thence it is four days' journey to Tibet, the country in whose forests
the musk is found. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">p.83</a></span>
Thence it takes twenty-eight days to
the mountains of Naisabur by the river Gozan. And there are men of
Israel in the land of Persia who say that in the mountains of Naisabur
four of the tribes of Israel dwell, namely, the tribe of Dan, the
tribe of Zebulun, the tribe of Asher, and the tribe of Naphtali, who
were included in the first captivity of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria,
as it is written (2 Kings xviii. 11): &quot;And he put them in Halah and in
Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The extent of their land is twenty days' journey, and they have cities
and large villages in the mountains; the river Gozan forms the
boundary on the one side. They are not under the rule of the Gentiles,
but they have a prince of their own, whose name is R. Joseph Amarkala
the Levite. There are scholars among them. And they sow and reap and
go forth to war as far as the land of Cush by way of the desert<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_60"></a>
<p>They are in league with the Kofar-al-Turak, who worship the wind and
live in the wilderness, and who do not eat bread, nor drink wine, but
live on raw uncooked meat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">p.84</a></span> They have no noses, and in lieu
thereof they have two small holes, through which they breathe. They
eat animals both clean and unclean, and they are very friendly towards
the Israelites. Fifteen years ago they overran the country of Persia
with a large army and took the city of Rayy<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>; they smote it with
the edge of the sword, took all the spoil thereof, and returned by way
of the wilderness. Such an invasion had not been known in the land of
Persia for many years. When the king of Persia heard thereof his anger
was kindled against them, and he said, &quot;Not in my days nor in the days
of my fathers did an army sally forth from this wilderness. Now I will
go and cut off their name from the earth.&quot; A proclamation was made
throughout his Empire, and he assembled all his armies; and he sought
a guide who might show him the way to their encampment. And a certain
man said that he would show him the way, as he was one of them. And
the king promised that he would enrich him if he did so. And the king
asked him as to what provisions they would require for the march
through the wilderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">p.85</a></span> And he replied, &quot;Take with you bread
and wine for fifteen days, for you will find no sustenance by the way,
till you have reached their land.&quot; And they did so, and marched
through the wilderness for fifteen days, but they found nothing at
all. And their food began to give out, so that man and beast were
dying of hunger and thirst. Then the king called the guide, and said
to him, &quot;Where is your promise to us that you would find our
adversaries?&quot; To which the other replied, &quot;I have mistaken the way.&quot;
And the king was wroth, and commanded that his head should be struck
off. And the king further gave orders throughout the camp that every
man who had any food should divide it with his neighbour. And they
consumed everything they had including their beasts. And after a
further thirteen days' march they reached the mountains of Naisabur,
where Jews lived. They came there on the Sabbath, and encamped in the
gardens and plantations and by the springs of water which are by the
side of the river Gozan. Now it was the time of the ripening of the
fruit, and they ate and consumed everything. No man came forth to
them, but on the mountains they saw cities and many towers.</p>

<p>Then the king commanded two of his servants to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">p.86</a></span> and inquire<a name="bpage_61"></a>
of the people who lived in the mountains, and to cross the river
either in boats or by swimming. So they searched and found a large
bridge, on which there were three towers, but the gate of the bridge
was locked. And on the other side of the bridge was a great city. Then
they shouted in front of the bridge till a man came forth and asked
them what they wanted and who they were. But they did not understand
him till an interpreter came who understood their language. And when
he asked them, they said, &quot;We are the servants of the king of Persia,
and we have come to ask who you are, and whom you serve.&quot; To which the
other replied: &quot;We are Jews; we have no king and no Gentile prince,
but a Jewish prince rules over us.&quot; They then questioned him with
regard to the infidels, the sons of Ghuz of the Kofar-al-Turak, and he
answered: &quot;Truly they are in league with us, and he who seeks to do
them harm seeks our harm.&quot; Then they went their way, and told the king
of Persia, who was much alarmed. And on a certain day the Jews asked
him to join combat with them, but he answered: &quot;I am not come to fight
you, but the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and if you fight against me I
will be avenged on you by killing all the Jews in my Empire; I know
that you are stronger than I am in this place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">p.87</a></span> and my army has
come out of this great wilderness starving and athirst. Deal kindly
with me and do not fight against me, but leave me to engage with the
Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and sell me also the provisions which I
require for myself and my army.&quot; The Jews then took counsel together,
and resolved to propitiate the king on account of the Jews who were in
exile in his Empire. Then the king entered their land with his army,
and stayed there fifteen days. And they showed him much honour, and
also sent a dispatch to the Kofar-al-Turak their allies, reporting the
matter to them. Thereupon the latter occupied the mountain passes in
force with a large army composed of all those who dwelt in that
desert, and when the king of Persia went forth to fight with them,
they placed themselves in battle array against him. The Kofar-al-Turak
army was victorious and slew many of the Persian host, and the king of
Persia fled with only a few followers to his own country<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_62"></a>
<p>Now a horseman, one of the servants of the king of Persia, enticed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">p.88</a></span>
a Jew, whose name was R. Moses, to come with him, and when he came
to the land of Persia this horseman made the Jew his slave. One day
the archers came before the king to give a display of their skill and
no one among them could be found to draw the bow like this R. Moses.
Then the king inquired of him by means of an interpreter who knew his
language, and he related all that the horseman had done to him.
Thereupon the king at once granted him his liberty, had him clad in
robes of silk, gave him gifts, and said to him, &quot;If thou wilt embrace
our religion, I will make thee a rich man and steward of my house,&quot;
but he answered, My lord, I cannot do this thing.&quot; Then the king took
him and placed him in the house of the Chief Rabbi of the Ispahan
community, Sar Shalom, who gave him his daughter to wife. This same R.
Moses told me all these things.</p>

<p>Thence one returns to the land of Khuzistan which is by the river
Tigris, and one goes down the river which falls into the Indian Ocean
unto an island called Kish<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. It is a six days' journey to reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">p.89</a></span>this island. The inhabitants neither sow nor reap. They
possess only one well, and there is no stream in the whole island, but
they drink rain-water. The merchants who come from India and the
islands encamp there with their wares. Moreover, men from Shinar,
El-Yemen and Persia bring thither all sorts of silk, purple and flax,
cotton, hemp, worked wool, wheat, barley, millet, rye, and all sorts
of food, and lentils of every description, and they trade with one
another, whilst the men from India bring great quantities of spices<a name="bpage_63"></a>
thither. The islanders act as middlemen, and earn their livelihood
thereby. There are about 500 Jews there.</p>

<p>Thence it is ten days' journey by sea to Katifa, where there are about
5,000 Jews. Here the bdellium is to be found<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. On the
twenty-fourth of Nisan rain falls upon the water, upon the surface of
which certain small sea-animals float which drink in the rain and then
shut themselves up, and sink to the bottom. And about the middle of
Tishri men descend to the bed of the sea by ropes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">p.90</a></span> collect
these shell-fish, then split them open and extract the pearls. This
pearl-fishery belongs to the King of the country, but is controlled by
a Jewish official.</p>

<p>Thence it is seven days' journey to Khulam which is the beginning of
the country of the Sun-worshippers<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. These are the sons of Cush,<a name="bpage_64"></a>
who read the stars, and are all black in colour. They are honest in
commerce. When merchants come to them from distant lands and enter the
harbour, three of the King's secretaries go down to them and record
their names, and then bring them before the King, whereupon the King
makes himself responsible even for their property which they leave in
the open, unprotected. There is an official who sits in his office,
and the owner of any lost property has only to describe it to him when
he hands it back. This custom prevails in all that country. From
Passover to New Year, that is all during the summer, no man can go out
of his house because of the sun, for the heat in that country is
intense, and from the third hour of the day onward, everybody remains
in his house till the evening. Then they go forth and kindle lights in
all the market places and all the streets, and then do their work and
business at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">p.91</a></span> night-time. For they have to turn night into day
in consequence of the great heat of the sun. Pepper is found there.
They plant the trees thereof in the fields, and each man of the city
knows his own plantation. The trees are small, and the pepper is as
white as snow. And when they have collected it, they place it in
saucepans and pour boiling water over it, so that it may become
strong. They then take it out of the water and dry it in the sun, and
it turns black. Calamus and ginger and many other kinds of spice are
found in this land.</p>

<p>The people of this country do not bury their dead, but embalm them by
means of various spices, after which they place them on chairs and
cover them with fine linen. And each family has a house where it
preserves the embalmed remains of its ancestors and relations. The
flesh hardens on the bones, and the embalmed bodies look like living
beings, so that every man can recognize his parents, and the members
of his family for many years. They worship the sun, and they have high
places everywhere outside the city at a distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">p. 92</a></span> about half
a mile. And every morning they run forth to greet the sun, for on
every high place a solar disc is made of cunning workmanship and as<a name="bpage_65"></a>
the sun rises the disc rotates with thundering noise, and all, both
men and women, offer incense to the sun with censers in their hands.
Such are their superstitious practices. And throughout the island,
including all the towns there, live several thousand Israelites. The
inhabitants are all black, and the Jews also. The latter are good and
benevolent. They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a
small extent the Talmud and Halacha.</p>

<p>Thence it is twenty-three days by sea to Ibrig<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>, and the
inhabitants are fire-worshippers, and are called Duchbin. Among them
are about 3,000 Jews, and these Duchbin have priests in their several
temples who are great wizards in all manner of witchcraft, and there
are none like them in all the earth. In front of the high place of
their temple there is a deep trench, where they keep a great fire
alight all the year, and they call it Elahutha. And they cause their
sons and daughters to pass through the fire, and even their
dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">p.93</a></span> they throw into it. Some of the great men of the country make a
vow to die by fire. In such cases the man communicates his intention
to the members of his household and his relations, and says:&mdash;&quot;I have
vowed to throw myself in the fire whilst I am yet alive,&quot; then they
answer, saying: &quot;Happy art thou.&quot; And when the day of the performance
of his vow arrives, they prepare for him a grand banquet, and if he is
rich he rides on horseback, if poor he goes on foot to the border of
the trench and throws himself into the fire. And all the members of
his family shout to the accompaniment of timbrels and dancing until
the body is entirely consumed. At the end of three days two of their
high priests come to his house and to his children and say unto them:
&quot;Arrange the house, for this day your father will come to give his
last directions as to what ye shall do.&quot; And they bring witnesses from
the city. Then Satan is made to appear in the likeness of the
deceased, and when his widow and children ask him how he fares in the
other world he answers: &quot;I went to my companions, but they would not<a name="bpage_66"></a>
receive me until I had discharged my obligations to the members of my house and to my
neighbours.&quot; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">p.94</a></span>Then he makes his will and divides his property among
his children, and gives directions that all his creditors should be
paid and that his debts should be collected. Then the witnesses write
out the will, and he goes his way and is seen no more. And by means of
this trickery and witchcraft which these priests practise, the people
are confirmed in their errors and assert that there is none in all the
land like their priests.</p>

<p>Thence to cross over to the land of Zin (China) is a voyage of forty
days. Zin is in the uttermost East, and some say that there is the Sea
of Nikpa (Ning-po?), where the star Orion predominates and stormy
winds prevail<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. At times the helmsman cannot govern his ship, as a
fierce wind drives her into this Sea of Nikpa, where she cannot move
from her place; and the crew have to remain where they are till their
stores of food are exhausted and then they die. In this way many a
ship has been lost, but men eventually discovered a device by which to
escape from this evil place. The crew provide themselves with hides
of oxen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">p.95</a></span> And when this evil wind blows which drives them
into the Sea of Nikpa, they wrap themselves up in the skins, which
they make waterproof, and, armed with knives, plunge into the sea. A
great bird called the griffin spies them out, and in the belief that
the sailor is an animal, the griffin seizes hold of him, brings him to
dry land, and puts him down on a mountain or in a hollow in order to
devour him. The man then quickly thrusts at the bird with a knife and
slays him. Then the man issues forth from the skin and walks till he
comes to an inhabited place. And in this manner many a man
escapes<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_67"></a>
<p>Thence to Al-Gingaleh is a voyage of fifteen days, and about
1,000 Israelites dwell there. Thence by sea to Chulan is seven days;
but no Jews live there. From there it is twelve days to Zebid, where
there are a few Jews. From there it is eight days' journey to India
which is on the mainland, called the land of Aden, and this is the
Eden which is in Thelasar<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. The country is mountainous. There are
many Israelites here, and they are not under the yoke of the Gentiles,
but possess cities and castles on the summits of the mountains, from
which they make descents into the plain-country called Lybia, which is
a Christian Empire. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">p.96</a></span>These are the Lybians of the land of Lybia, with
whom the Jews are at war. The Jews take spoil and booty and retreat to
the mountains, and no man can prevail against them. Many of these Jews
of the land of Aden come to Persia and Egypt<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence to the land of Assuan is a journey of twenty days through the<a name="bpage_68"></a>
desert. This is Seba on the river Pishon (Nile) which descends from
the land of Cush<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. And some of these sons of Cush have a king whom
they call the Sultan Al-Habash. There is a people among them who, like
animals, eat of the herbs that grow on the banks of the Nile and in
the fields. They go about naked and have not the intelligence of
ordinary men. They cohabit with their sisters and any one they find.
The climate is very hot. When the men of Assuan make a raid into their
land, they take with them bread and wheat, dry grapes and figs, and
throw the food to these people, who run after it. Thus they
bring many of them back prisoners, and sell them in the l<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">p.97</a></span>and of Egypt
and in the surrounding countries. And these are the black slaves, the
sons of Ham.</p>

<p>From Assuan it is a distance of twelve days to Heluan where there are
about 300 Jews. Thence people travel in caravans a journey of fifty
days through the great desert called Sahara, to the land of Zawilah,
which is Havilah in the land of Gana<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. In this desert there are<a name="bpage_69"></a>
mountains of sand, and when the wind rises, it covers the caravans
with the sand, and many die from suffocation. Those that escape bring
back with them copper, wheat, fruit, all manner of lentils, and salt.
And from thence they bring gold, and all kinds of jewels. This is in
the land of Cush which is called Al-Habash on the western
confines<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. From Heluan it is thirteen days' journey to Kutz which
is K&#363;s, and this is the commencement of the land of Egypt. At Kutz
there are 300 Jews<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. Thence it is 300 miles to Fayum, which is
Pithom, where there are 200 Jews; and unto this very day one can see
ruins of the buildings which our forefathers erected there<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence to Mizraim is a journey of four days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">p.98</a></span> This Mizraim is
the great city situated on the banks of the Nile, which is Pison or
Al-Nil<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. The number of Jewish inhabitants is about 7,000. Two<a name="bpage_70"></a>
large synagogues are there, one belonging to the men of the land of
Israel and one belonging to the men of the land of Babylon. The
synagogue of the men of the land of Israel is called
Kenisat-al-Schamiyyin, and the synagogue of the men of Babylon is
called Kenisat-al-Irakiyyin. Their usage with regard to the portions
and sections of the Law is not alike; for the men of Babylon are
accustomed to read a portion every week, as is done in Spain, and is
our custom, and to finish the Law each year; whilst the men of
Palestine do not do so, but divide each portion into three sections
and finish the Law at the end of three years. The two communities,
however, have an established custom to unite and pray together on the
day of the Rejoicing of the Law, and on the day of the Giving of the
Law<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. Among the Jews is Nethanel the Prince of</p>
<a name="bpage_71"></a>
<p>Princes and the head of the Academy, who is the head of all the
congregations in Egypt<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>; he appoints Rabbis and officials, and is
attached to the court of the great King, who lives in his palace of
Zoan el-Medina, which is the royal city for the Arabs. Here resides the Emir al Muminin, a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">p.99</a></span>descendant of Abu Talib. All
his subjects are called &quot;Alawiyyim<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>,&quot; because they rose up against
the Emir al Muminin al Abbasi (the Abbaside Caliph) who resides at
Bagdad. And between the two parties there is a lasting feud, for the
former have set up a rival throne in Zoan (Egypt).</p>

<p>Twice in the year the Egyptian monarch goes forth, once on the
occasion of the great festival, and again when the river Nile rises.
Zoan is surrounded by a wall, but Mizraim has no wall, for the river
encompasses it on one side. It is a great city, and it has
market-places as well as inns in great number. The Jews that dwell
there are very rich. No rain falls, neither is ice or snow ever seen.
The climate is very hot.</p>

<p>The river Nile rises once a year in the month of Elul; it covers all
the land, and irrigates it to a distance of fifteen days' journey. The
waters remain upon the surface of the land during the months of Elul
and Tishri, and irrigate and fertilize it.</p>

<p>The inhabitants have a pillar of marble, erected with much skill, in
order to ascertain the extent of the rise of the Nile. It stands in
the front of an island in the midst of the water, and is twelve cubits
high<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. When the Nile rises and covers the column, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">p.100</a></span>they know that<a name="bpage_72"></a>
the river has risen and has covered the land for a distance
of fifteen days' journey to its full extent. If only half the column
is covered, the water only covers half the extent of the land. And day
by day an officer takes a measurement on the column and makes
proclamation thereof in Zoan and in the city of Mizraim, proclaiming:
&quot;Give praise unto the Creator, for the river this day has risen to
such and such a height&quot;; each day he takes the measurement and makes
his proclamation. If the water covers the entire column, there will be
abundance throughout Egypt. The river continues to rise gradually till
it covers the land to the extent of fifteen days' journey. He who owns
a field hires workmen, who dig deep trenches in his field, and fish
come with the rise of the water and enter the trenches. Then, when the
waters have receded, the fish remain behind in the trenches, and the
owners of the fields take them and either eat them or sell them to the
fishmongers, who salt them and deal in them in every place. These fish
are exceedingly fat and large, and the oil obtained from them is used
in this land for lamp-oil. Though a man eat a great quantity of these
fish, if he but drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">p.101</a></span> Nile water afterwards they will not hurt him,
for the waters have medicinal properties.</p>

<p>People ask, what causes the Nile to rise? The Egyptians say that up
the river, in the land of Al-Habash (Abyssinia), which is the land of
Havilah, much rain descends at the time of the rising of the river,
and that this abundance of rain causes the river to rise and to cover
the surface of the land<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. <a name="bpage_73"></a>
If the river does not rise, there is no
sowing, and famine is sore in the land. Sowing is done in the month of
Marheshwan, after the river has gone back to its ordinary channel. In
the month of Adar is the barley-harvest, and in the month of Nisan the
wheat-harvest.</p>

<p>In the month of Nisan they have cherries, pears, cucumbers, and gourds
in plenty, also beans, peas, chickpeas, and many kinds of vegetables,
such as purslane, asparagus, pulse, lettuce, coriander, endive,
cabbage, leek, and cardoon. The land is full of all good things, and
the gardens and plantations are watered from the various reservoirs
and by the river-water.</p>

<p>The river Nile, after flowing past (the city of) Mizraim, divides into
four heads: one channel proceeds in the direction of Damietta, which
is Caphtor<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>, where it falls into the sea. The second channel flows
to the city of Reshid (Rosetta),<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102"
id="page_102">p.102</a></span> which is near Alexandria,
and there falls into the sea; the third channel goes by way of Ashmun,
where it falls into the sea; and the fourth channel goes as far as the
frontier of Egypt<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. Along both banks of these four river-heads are
cities, towns and villages, and people visit these places either by
ship or by land. There is no such thickly-populated land as this
elsewhere. It is extensive too and abundant in all good things.</p>

<p>From New Mizraim unto Old Mizraim is a distance of two parasangs. The
latter is in ruins, and the place where walls and houses stood can be
seen to the present day. The store-houses also of Joseph of blessed
memory are to be found in great numbers in many places. They are built
of lime and stone, and are exceedingly strong<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. A pillar is there
of marvellous workmanship, the like of which cannot be seen throughout
the world.</p>
<a name="bpage_74"></a>
<p>Outside the city is the ancient synagogue of Moses our master, of
blessed memory, and the overseer and clerk of this place of worship is
a venerable old man; he is a man of learning, and they call him Al
Sheik Abu al-Nazr<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. The extent of Mizraim, which is in ruins, is
three miles. Thence to the land of Goshen is eight parasangs;
here is Bilbais<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103"
id="page_103">p.103</a></span> There are about 300 Jews in the city, which is
a large one. Thence it is half a day's journey to Ain-al-Shams or
Ramses, which is in ruins. Traces are there to be seen of the
buildings which our fore-fathers raised, namely, towers built of
bricks. From here it is a day's journey to Al Bubizig, where there are
about 200 Jews. Thence it is half a day to Benha, where there are
about 60 Jews. Thence it takes half a day to Muneh Sifte, where there
are 500 Jews<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. From there it is half a day's journey to Samnu,
where there are about 200 Jews. Thence it is four parasangs to Damira,
where there are about 700 Jews. From there it is five days to
Lammanah, where there are about 500 Jews<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. Two days' journey takes
one to Alexandria of Egypt, which is Ammon of No; but when Alexander
of Macedon built the city, he called it after his own name, and made
it exceedingly strong and beautiful<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. The houses, the palaces, and<a name="bpage_75"></a>
the walls are of excellent architecture. Outside the town is the
academy of Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander. This is a large
building, standing between other academies to the number of twenty,
with a column of marble between each. People from the whole world were
wont to come hither in order to study the wisdom of Aristotle the
philosopher. The city is built over a hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">p.104</a></span> by means of
arches. Alexander built it with great understanding. The streets are
wide and straight, so that a man can look along them for a mile from
gate to gate, from the gate of Reshid to the gate by the sea.</p>

<p>Alexander also built for the harbour of Alexandria a pier, a king's
highway running into the midst of the sea. And there he erected a
large tower, a lighthouse, called Manar al Iskandriyyah in Arabic. On
the top of the tower there is a glass mirror. Any ships that attempted
to attack or molest the city, coming from Greece or from the Western
lands, could be seen by means of this mirror of glass at a distance of
twenty days' journey, and the inhabitants could thereupon put
themselves on their guard. It happened once, many years after the
death of Alexander, that a ship came from the land of Greece, and the
name of the captain was Theodoros, a Greek of great cleverness. The
Greeks at that time were under the yoke of Egypt. The captain brought
great gifts in silver and gold and garments of silk to the King of
Egypt, and he moored his ship in front of the lighthouse, as
was the custom of all merchants.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">p.105</a></span>
<p>Every day the guardian of the lighthouse and his servants had their
meals with him, until the captain came to be on such friendly terms
with the keeper that he could go in and out at all times. And one day
he gave a banquet, and caused the keeper and all his servants to drink
a great deal of wine. When they were all asleep, the captain and his
servants arose and broke the mirror and departed that very night. From
that day onward the Christians began to come thither with boats and
large ships, and eventually captured the large island called Crete and
also Cyprus, which are under the dominion of the Greeks. [The other
MSS. add here: Ever since then, the men of the King of Egypt have been
unable to prevail over the Greeks.] To this day the lighthouse is a
landmark to all seafarers who come to Alexandria; for one can see it
at a distance of 100 miles by day, and at night the keeper lights a
torch which the mariners can see from a distance, and thus sail
towards it<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</p>
<a name="bpage_76"></a>
<p>Alexandria is a commercial market for all nations. Merchants come
thither from all the Christian kingdoms: on the one side,
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">p.106</a></span>the land of Venetia and Lombardy, Tuscany, Apulia, Amalfi,
Sicilia, Calabria, Romagna, Khazaria, Patzinakia, Hungaria, Bulgaria,
Rakuvia (Ragusa?), Croatia, Slavonia, Russia, Alamannia (Germany),
Saxony, Danemark, Kurland? Ireland? Norway (Norge?), Frisia, Scotia,
Angleterre, Wales, Flanders, Hainault? Normandy, France, Poitiers,
Anjou, Burgundy, Maurienne, Provence, Genoa, Pisa, Gascony, Aragon,
and Navarra<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>, and towards the west under the sway of the
Mohammedans, Andalusia, Algarve, Africa and the land of the Arabs: and
on the other side India, Zawilah, Abyssinia, Lybia, El-Yemen, Shinar,
Esh-Sham (Syria); also Javan, whose people are called the Greeks, and
the Turks. And merchants of India bring thither all kinds of spices,
and the merchants of Edom buy of them. And the city is a busy one and
full of traffic. Each nation has an inn of its own.</p>

<p>By the sea-coast there is a sepulchre of marble on which are engraved
all manner of beasts and birds; an effigy is in the midst thereof, and
all the writing is in ancient characters, which no one knows now. Men<a name="bpage_77"></a>
suppose that it is the sepulchre of a king who lived in early
times<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">p.107</a></span> before the Deluge. The length of the sepulchre is fifteen
spans, and its breadth is six spans. There are about 3,000 Jews in
Alexandria.</p>

<p>Thence it is two days' journey to Damietta which is Caphtor, where
there are about 200 Jews, and it lies upon the sea. Thence it is one
day's journey to Simasim; it contains about 100 Jews. From there it is
half a day to Sunbat; the inhabitants sow flax and weave linen, which
they export to all parts of the world<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>. Thence it is four days to
Ailam, which is Elim<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. It belongs to the Arabs who dwell in the
wilderness. Thence it is two days' journey to Rephidim where the Arabs
dwell, but there are no Jews there<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. A day's journey from thence
takes one to Mount Sinai. On the top of the mountain is a large
convent belonging to the great monks called Syrians<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. At the foot
of the mountain is a large town called Tur Sinai; the inhabitants
speak the language of the Targum (Syriac). It is close to a small
mountain, five days distant from Egypt. The inhabitants are under<a name="bpage_78"></a>
Egyptian rule. At a day's journey from Mount Sinai is [<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>the Red
Sea, which is an arm of the Indian Ocean. We return to Damietta. From
there it is a day's journey to] Tanis, which is Hanes, where there are
about 40 Jews. It is an island in the midst of the
sea<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. Thus far<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">p.108</a></span> extends the empire of Egypt.</p>

<p>Thence it takes twenty days by sea to Messina, which is the
commencement of Sicily and is situated on the arm of the sea that is
called Lipar<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>, which divides it from Calabria. Here about 200 Jews
dwell. It is a land full of everything good, with gardens and
plantations. Here most of the pilgrims assemble to cross over to
Jerusalem, as this is the best crossing. Thence it is about two days'
journey to Palermo, which is a large city. Here is the palace of King
William. Palermo contains about 1,500 Jews and a large number of
Christians and Mohammedans<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. It is in a district abounding in
springs and brooks of water, a land of wheat and barley, likewise of
gardens and plantations, and there is not the like thereof in the
whole island of Sicily. Here is the domain and garden of the king,
which is called Al Harbina (Al Hacina)<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>, containing all sorts of
fruit-trees. And in it is a large fountain. The garden is encompassed<a name="bpage_79"></a>
by a wall. And a reservoir has been made there which is called Al
Buheira<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>, and in it are many sorts of fish. Ships overlaid with
silver and gold are there, belonging to the king, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">p.109</a></span>who takes
pleasure-trips in them with his women<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. In the park there is also
a great palace, the walls of which are painted, and overlaid with gold
and silver; the paving of the floors is of marble, picked out in gold
and silver in all manner of designs. There is no building like this
anywhere. And this island, the commencement of which is Messina,
contains all the pleasant things of this world. It embraces Syracuse,
Marsala, Catania, Petralia, and Trapani, the circumference of the
island being six days' journey. In Trapani coral is found, which is
called Al Murgan<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.</p>

<p>Thence people pass to the city of Rome in ten days. And from Rome they
proceed by land to Lucca, which is a five days' journey. Thence they
cross the mountain of Jean de Maurienne, and the passes of Italy. It
is twenty days' journey to Verdun, which is the commencement of
Alamannia, a land of mountains and hills. All the congregations of
Alamannia are situated on the great river Rhine, from the city of
Cologne, which is the principal town of the Empire, to the city of
Regensburg, a distance of fifteen days' journey at the other extremity<a name="bpage_80"></a>
of Alamannia, otherwise called Ashkenaz. And the following <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">p.110</a></span>
are the cities in the land of Alamannia, which have Hebrew
congregations: Metz, Treves on the river Moselle, Coblenz, Andernach,
Bonn, Cologne, Bingen, M&uuml;nster, Worms,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> [All Israel is dispersed
in every land, and he who does not further the gathering of Israel
will not meet with happiness nor live with Israel. When the Lord will
remember us in our exile, and raise the horn of his anointed, then
every one will say, &quot;I will lead the Jews and I will gather them.&quot; As
for the towns which have been mentioned, they contain scholars and
communities that love their brethren, and speak peace to those that
are near and afar, and when a wayfarer comes they rejoice, and make a
feast for him, and say, &quot;Rejoice, brethren, for the help of the Lord
comes in the twinkling of an eye.&quot; If we were not afraid that the
appointed time has not yet arrived nor been reached, we would have
gathered together, but we dare not do so until the time for song has
arrived, and the voice of the turtle-dove (is heard in the land), when
the messengers will come and say continually, &quot;The Lord be exalted.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">p.111</a></span> Meanwhile they send missives one to the other, saying, &quot;Be ye
strong in the law of Moses, and do ye mourners for Zion and ye
mourners for Jerusalem entreat the Lord, and may the supplication of
those that wear the garments of mourning be received through their
merits.&quot; In addition to the several cities which we have mentioned
there are besides] Strassburg, W&uuml;rzburg, Mantern, Bamberg, Freising,
and Regensburg at the extremity of the Empire<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. In these cities
there are many Israelites, wise men and rich.</p>

<p>Thence extends the land of Bohemia, called Prague<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. This is the
commencement of the land of Slavonia, and the Jews who dwell there
call it Canaan, because the men of that land (the Slavs) sell their
sons and their daughters to the other nations. These are the men of
Russia, which is a great empire stretching from the gate of Prague to<a name="bpage_81"></a>
the gates of Kieff, the large city which is at the extremity of that
empire<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. It is a land of mountains and forests, where there are to
be found the animals called vair<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, ermine, and sable. No one
issues forth from his house<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112"
id="page_112">p.112 </a></span> in winter-time on account of
the cold. People are to be found there who have lost the tips of their
noses by reason of the frost. Thus far reaches the empire of Russia.</p>

<p>The kingdom of France, which is Zarfath, extends from the town of
Auxerre<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> unto Paris, the great city&mdash;a journey of six days. The
city belongs to King Louis. It is situated on the river Seine.
Scholars are there, unequalled in the whole world, who study the Law
day and night. They are charitable and hospitable to all travellers,
and are as brothers and friends unto all their brethren the Jews. May
God, the Blessed One, have mercy upon us and upon them!</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a></p>  <p> Tudela was called in Benjamin's time <i>Tuteila</i>. Sepharad is Spain.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></p>  <p> There is a considerable difference of opinion as to the exact dates at
  which Benjamin began and completed his journey. In my opinion,
  the period can be placed within a very narrow compass. Early in his
  journey he visited Rome, where he found R. Jechiel to be the steward
  of the household of Pope Alexander. This can be no other than Pope
  Alexander III, who played so important a part in the struggle between
  King Henry II and Thomas a Becket. The German Emperor, Frederick
  Barbarossa, supported the anti-Pope Victor IV, and in consequence
  Alexander had to leave Rome soon after his election in 1159 and before
  his consecration. He did not return to settle down permanently in Rome
  until November 23, 1165, but was forced to leave again in 1167. Consequently
  Benjamin must have been in Rome between the end of 1165
  and 1167. Benjamin terminated his travels by passing from Egypt to
  Sicily and Italy, then crossing the Alps and visiting Germany. In Cairo
  he found that the Fatimite Caliph was the acknowledged ruler. The
  Caliph here referred to must have been El-'Adid, who died on Monday,
  September 13, 1171&mdash;being the last of the Fatimite line. A short time
  before his death, Saladin had become the virtual ruler of Egypt, and
  had ordered the Khotba to be read in the name of the Abbaside Caliph
  el-Mostadi of Bagdad. (See the <i>Life of Saladin</i>, by Bohadin: Palestine
  Pilgrims' Text Society, p. 61.) It is clear, therefore, that Benjamin's
  absence from Europe must be placed between the years 1166 and 1171.
  Benjamin on his return journey passed through Sicily when the island
  was no longer governed by a viceroy. King William II (the Good)
  attained his majority in 1169, and Benjamin's visit took place subsequently.
  It will be found in the course of the narrative that not
  a single statement by Benjamin is inconsistent with this determination
  of date; see p. 3, n. 4; p. 9, n. 2; p. 15, n. 4; p. 61, n. 1; and p. 79, n. 2.</p></div>

  the Emperor Manuel Comnenus. Malmistras is forty-five miles from

  Ancient Antioch lies on the slope of Mount Silpius, and the city-wall
  erected by Justinian extended from the river up to the hill-plateau.
  Abulfeda says: &quot;The river of Ham&acirc;h is also called Al Urunt or the
  Nahr al Makl&ucirc;b (the Overturned) on account of its course from south
  to north; or, again, it is called Al' &Acirc;si (the Rebel), for the reason that
  though most rivers water the lands on their borders without the aid
  of water-wheels, the river of Ham&acirc;h will not irrigate the lands except
  by the aid of machines for raising its waters.&quot; (Guy le Strange,
  <i>Palestine under the Moslems</i>, p. 59.) It is strange that R. Benjamin should
  call the Orontes the river Jabbok, but he always takes care to add that
  it rises in the Lebanon, to avoid any misconception that the Jabbok
  which falls into the Jordan is meant.</p></div>

  See Socin, <i>Palestine and Syria</i>, pp. 68 and 99. Ibn Batuta and other
  Arabic writers have much to say about the Assassins or Mulahids, as
  they call them. They are again referred to by Benjamin on p. 54,
  where he states that in Persia they haunted the mountainous district
  of Mulahid, under the sway of the Old Man of the Mountain. The
  manner in which the Sheik acquired influence over his followers is
  amusingly described by Marco Polo (<i>The Book of Ser Marco Polo</i>: translated
  and edited by Colonel Sir Henry Yule; third edition, London,
  John Murray, 1903): &quot;In a fertile and sequestered valley he placed every
  conceivable thing pleasant to man&mdash;luxurious palaces, delightful gardens,
  fair damsels skilled in music, dancing, and song, in short, a veritable
  paradise! When desirous of sending any of his band on some hazardous
  enterprise the Old Man would drug them and place them while unconscious
  in this glorious valley. But it was not for many days that
  they were allowed to revel in the joys of paradise. Another potion was
  given to them, and when the young men awoke they found themselves
  in the presence of the Old Man of the Mountain. In the hope of again
  possessing the joys of paradise they were ready to embark upon any
  desperate errand commanded by the Old Man.&quot; Marco Polo mentions
   that the Old Man found crafty deputies, who with their followers settled
  in parts of Syria and Kurdistan. He adds that, in the year 1252, Ala&uuml;,
  lord of the Tartars of the Levant, made war against the Old Man, and
  slaughtered him with many of his followers. Yule gives a long list of
  murders or attempts at murder ascribed to the Assassins. Saladin's
  life was attempted in 1174-6. Prince Edward of England was slain
  at Acre in 1172. The sect is not quite extinct. They have spread to
  Bombay and Zanzibar, and number in Western India over 50,000. The
  mention of the Old Man of the Mountain will recall to the reader the
  story of Sinbad the Sailor in <i>The Arabian Nights</i>.</p></div>

  at Hebron. The MS. of Count Riant further mentions that before the
  occupation of Hebron by the Arabs, the Greeks had blocked up and concealed
  the entrance to the caves. The Jews subsequently disclosed the
  place of the entrance to the Moslems, receiving as recompense permission
  to build a synagogue close by. This was no doubt the Jewish place of

  In scripture, Gen. x. 18, the Zemarite and the Hamathite are

  intermittent spring of Fuw&acirc;r ed-Der, the Sabbatio River of antiquity,
  which Titus visited after the destruction of Jerusalem. Josephus (<i>Wars of
  the Jews</i>, Book VII, sec. 5) describes it as follows: &quot;Its current is strong
  and has plenty of water; after which its springs fail for six days together
  and leave its channels dry, as any one may see; after which days it runs
  on the seventh day as it did before, and as though it had undergone no
  change at all: it has also been observed to keep this order perpetually
  and exactly.&quot; The intermittent action is readily accounted for by the
  stream having hollowed out an underground duct, which acts as a syphon.</p></div>

  appeared to under-estimate the Jewish population. Henceforth it will

  colour to the view that Benjamin did not proceed beyond Ispahan, but
  found his way thence direct to Egypt. The statements concerning the
  intervening places must therefore be taken to have been based upon
  hearsay information. Pethachia's remarks are significant: &quot;In the

  are in the land of Persia. But in Persia the Jews are subject to hard

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_126_126" id="Footnote_126_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_126_126"> [126]</a></p> <p> A valuable work, <i>Bagdad during the Abbaside Caliphate, from Contemporary
  Arabic and Persian Sources</i>, appeared in 1900, written by Mr. Guy Le Strange,
  which helps to explain Benjamin's account of the Moslem metropolis. The
  Caliph Mansur in 762 selected it as the Capital of the Empire. Numerous
  references in the Talmud prove that a Jewish settlement was there
  long before. Mansur built a double-walled Round City two miles in
  diameter on the western side of the Tigris. It formed the nucleus of
  suburbs, which spread over both banks of the Tigris. A very fair idea of
  the metropolis may be obtained if we imagine the Round City as situated
  on the Surrey side of the Thames, having the &quot;Elephant and Castle&quot; for
  its centre. At this spot stood the great Mosque of Mansur, where the
  Friday services were held, and where the Caliph took a prominent part
  in the service on the Bairam, at the close of the Ramazan fast. The
  Round City being subject to periodical inundations, the government
  buildings were gradually transferred to the eastern side of the river. The
  Royal Palaces, in the grounds called the Harim, which were fully three
  miles in extent, occupied the site similar to that from Westminster to the
  City. At one time there were as many as twenty-three palaces within the
  royal precincts. The Caliph, when visiting the Mosque in state, left
  the palace grounds, and proceeded over the main bridge, corresponding to
  Westminster Bridge, along a road which in Benjamin's time led to the
  Basrah Gate quarter. At the close of the ceremony in the Mosque, the
  Caliph returned, crossing the bridge of boats, and proceeded to his palace
  by a road corresponding to the Thames Embankment. The members of
  his court and the nobles entered barges and escorted him alongside the
  river.
</p><p>
  The Arab writers mention that certain palaces were used as state
  prisons, in which the Caliphs kept their nearer relations in honourable
  confinement. They were duly attended by numerous servants, and amply
  supplied with every luxury, but forbidden under pain of death to go
  beyond the walls. Lebrecht, p. 381, explains the circumstances under
  which the Caliph Moktafi imprisoned his brother and several of his
  kinsmen. There were large hospitals in Bagdad: the one to which
  Benjamin alludes is the Birmaristan of the Mustansiriyah, in Western
  Bagdad, which for three centuries was a great school of medical science.
  Its ruins, close to the present bridge of boats, are still to be seen. The
  reader must bear in mind that at the time when Benjamin visited
  Bagdad, the Seljuk Sultans had been defeated, and the Caliphs stood
  higher than ever in power. They, however, took little interest in
  political affairs, which were left entirely in the hands of their viziers.</p></div>

  regions of the Caucasus. As to the Iron Gates which Alexander made,
  Yule in commenting on Marco Polo's text (<i>Travels of Ser Marco Polo:</i>
  edited by Sir Henry Yule, 3rd edition, London, John Murray, chap, iii)
  says that Benjamin was the first European traveller to mention this pass.
  Benjamin and Marco Polo both record the general belief currrent at
  the time that the Pass of Derbend was traversed by Alexander.
  It is still called in Turkish &quot;Demis-Kapi&quot; or the Iron Gate, and the
  Persians designate it &quot;Sadd-i-Iskandar&quot;&mdash;the Rampart of Alexander.
  Lord Curzon, however, in his valuable work <i>Persia and the Persians</i>, vol. 1,
  p. 293, proves conclusively that the pass through which Alexander's
  army marched when pursuing Darius after the battle of Arbela could not
  have been at Derbend. Arrian, the historian of Alexander's expeditions,
  writes that the pass was one day's journey from Rages (the noted city
  mentioned in the Book of Tobit) for a man marching at the pace of
  Alexander's army. But Derbend is fully 500 miles from Rages. In Lord
  Curzon's opinion, confirmed by Spiegel, Droysen and Schindler, the Sirdara
  Pass, some forty miles from Teheran on the way to Meshed, must
  have been the defile which Alexander's army forced. I think it will be
  found that Marco Polo's geography is less reliable than that of Benjamin.
  In the third chapter referred to above, Marco Polo speaks of the Euphrates
  falling into the Caspian Sea.</p></div>

  &quot;The mound rises abruptly to the height of 198 feet, and has on its

  On one side of it, beneath the crowning masonry, lie huge fragments

  bricks, fused into rock-like masses, show that their fall may have been
  caused by lightning. The ruin is rent almost from top to bottom. No
  traces whatever now remain of the spiral passage spoken of by the
  Jewish traveller.&quot; Cf. Professor T. K. Cheyne's article, &quot;The Tower of
  Babel,&quot; in the new <i>Biblical Cyclopaedia</i>. Nebuchadnezzar, in his Borsippa
  inscription, records that the tower, which had never originally been
  completed, had fallen into decay, and that the kiln-bricks had split.
  These are the Agur bricks mentioned by Benjamin; cf. Isaiah xxvii. 9.
  Al-ajur is the word still used by the Arabs for kiln-burnt bricks.</p></div>

  Layard, speaking of Birs Nimroud, says: &quot;To the south-west in the

   over a small dome, the tomb of Ezekiel. To this spot occasionally flock
  in crowds, as their forefathers have done for centuries, the Jews of
  Bagdad, Hillah, and other cities of Chaldea.... It is now but a plain
  building, despoiled of the ornaments and MSS. which it once appears to

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_140_140" id="Footnote_140_140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_140_140"> [140]</a></p> <p> This Mohammed, as in the case referred to p. 40, must have been
  a predecessor of the reigning Caliph, as the Prophet was never in
  Babylonia, and in no case would he have granted favours to the Jews.
  It should be noted that the British Museum MS. on which our text
  is based, as well as the Casanatense MS., generally styles the Prophet <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image56.gif" width="58" height="18">.
  The MS., on which the Constantinople <i>editio princeps</i> is based,
  had probably all passages where this epithet or other objectionable
  remarks were used excised by the censor, and it will be seen that the
  passage before us, with reference to the grant of land by Mohammed,
  as well as that further on, referring to Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed,
  do not appear in any of the printed editions. Dr. Hirschfeld is of opinion that, on the one hand, the epithet is the translation of the
  Arabic <i>majn&#363;n</i>, a term against which Mohammed protested several times
  in the Koran, because it means he was possessed by a <i>jinn</i>, like a soothsayer.
  On the other hand, the word was chosen having regard to Hosea
  ix. 7. This was done long before Benjamin's time, by Jafeth and others.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146"> [146]</a></p> <p> Asher, at this stage of Benjamin's narrative, has the following note:
  &quot;For the illustration of that portion of our text which treats of Arabia,
  we refer the reader to the Rev. S.L. Rapoport's paper, 'Independent
  Jews of Arabia,' which will be found at the end of these notes.&quot; No such
  account appeared in the work, but in the <i>Bikkure Haittim</i> for the year 1824,
  p. 51, there appears an interesting essay in Hebrew on the subject by
  Rapoport, to which the reader is referred. It is a matter of history that
  the powerful independent Jewish communities which were settled at
  Yathrib, afterwards called Medina, and in the volcanic highlands of
  Kheibar and Teima called the Harrah, were crushed by Mohammed.
  Dr. Hirschfeld, in the <i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, vol. XV, p. 170, gives us
  the translation of a letter found in the Cairo <i>Genizah</i>, addressed by
  Mohammed to the people of Kheibar and Maqna, granting them certain
  privileges from which the Jews, who were allowed to remain in their
  homes, benefited. Omar, the second Caliph, broke the compact, but
  allowed them to settle at Kufa on the Euphrates. Although pilgrims
  pass annually up and down the caravan tracks to Mecca, the information
  respecting the old Jewish sites in the Harrah is most meagre. Edrisi
  and Abulfeda throw no light on Benjamin's account. In the year
  1904 an able work by Mr. D.G. Hogarth appeared under the title of
  <i>The Penetration of Arabia</i>, being a record of the development of Western
  knowledge concerning the Arabian Peninsula. He gives a full account
  of the European travellers who have described the country. Niebuhr,
  who visited Yemen in 1762, repeated the statement made by the Italian
  traveller Varthema that there were still wild Jews in Kheibar. The
  missionary Joseph Woolf visited Arabia in 1836, and he gives us an
  account of an interview he had with some of the Rechabites. No weight,
  however, can be attached to his fantastic stories. W.G. Palgrave, who
  resided for some years in Syria as a Jesuit, where he called himself
  Father Michael (Cohen), was entrusted in 1862 with a mission to Arabia
  by Napoleon III in connexion with the projected Suez Canal; he was one
  of the few visitors to the Harrah, but he makes no special reference to
  the Jews. Joseph Halevi made many valuable discoveries of inscriptions
  in South Arabia, which he traversed in 1869. He visited the oppressed
  Jewish community at Sanaa in Yemen; he further discovered traces of
  the ancient Minaean kingdom, and found that the Jews in the Nejran
  were treated with singular tolerance and even favour; but he was not
  able to tell us anything respecting the Jews of the Harrah.
</p><p>
  C.M. Doughty was, however, more successful when visiting this district
  in 1875. Of Kheibar he says &quot;that it is now a poor village whose
  inhabitants are a terrible kindred, Moslems outwardly, but, in secret,
  cruel Jews that will suffer no stranger to enter among them.&quot; See
  C.M. Doughty's <i>Arabia Deserta</i>, vol. II, p. 129. &quot;Teima is a Nejd colony of
  Shammar; their fathers came to settle there not above 200 years past.
  Old Teima of the Jews, according to their tradition, had been (twice)
  destroyed by flood. From those times there remain some great rude
  stone buildings. It is now a prosperous open place&quot; (vol. I, p. 286).
</p><p>
  The only writer that casts any doubt upon Benjamin's record as to
  independent Jewish tribes in Arabia is R. Jacob Safir, who visited
  Yemen and other Arabian ports in the Red Sea in the year 1864. See
  chaps. xv and xliii of <i>Iben Safir</i>, Lyck, 1866. Dr. L. Gr&uuml;nhut, in his
  introduction, <i>Die Reisebeschreibungen des R. Benjamin von Tudela</i>, Jerusalem,
  1903, p. 16, refutes Safir's statements.
</p><p>
  In Hogarth's work, p. 282, is shown a print of the Teima stone, with
  its Aramaic inscription, considered to belong to the fourth or fifth
  century B.C., and on p. 285 will be found Doughty's interesting sketch of
  Kheibar.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_147_147" id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147"> [147]</a></p> <p> It is clear that, when speaking of the population of some of these
  places, the whole oasis or district is intended, and not a particular town.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_148_148" id="Footnote_148_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148_148"> [148]</a></p> <p> In reading through the foregoing account of the Jews in Arabia, it is
  quite clear that Benjamin never visited the country, nor did he pretend
  to have done so. In the words of Mr. C. E. Beazley (The Dawn of Modern
  Geography, p. 252), &quot;It is no longer, for the most part, a record of personal
  travel; it is rather an attempt to supplement the first part 'of things
  seen' by a second 'of things heard.'&quot; But Beazley is wrong when he
  characterizes as &quot;wild&quot; the account of the Jews of Southern Arabia &quot;who
  were Rechabites.&quot; Does Benjamin say so? There is no such reading in the
  MS. of the British Museum. The student, it is thought, will by this time
  have come to the conclusion that it is the oldest and most trustworthy of
  our available authorities. The whole misconception has arisen from the
  fact that the unreliable MS. E and all the printed editions have transposed
  the letters of <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image25.gif" width="164" height="18">of it. Rapoport, in the article
  already referred to, seems to suspect the faulty reading: to justify it, he
  connects the men of Kheibar with the Rechabites and the sons of Heber
  the Kenite, basing his argument upon Jer. xxxv, Judges i. 16, I Sam.
  xxvii. 10, and I Chron. ii. 55.
</p><p>
  Neither Zunz nor Asher makes any comments upon this chapter of the
  itinerary. Graetz gives an abstract of Benjamin's account; he, as well as
  all other writers, is unable to identify Tilmas, but is of opinion that
  Tanai must be Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, which, however, is twenty-five
  days' journey beyond Kheibar. It is well known that Yemen has,
  since Bible times, harboured a Jewish population, who&mdash;notwithstanding
  all oppression, intensified under Turkish rule&mdash;inhabit many of its towns
  and villages to the present day. It is comparatively accessible, owing
  to its proximity to the sea. We must cherish the hope that Great
  Britain, now that it claims the Hinterland of Aden, will extend its
  protection to the Jews.
</p><p>
  The volcanic highlands (Harrah) of Kheibar were always inaccessible,
  owing to their being surrounded by waterless deserts and fanatic Bedouin
  tribes.
</p><p>
  R. Abraham Farissol, who flourished at the beginning of the sixteenth
  century, writes that there was a large number of Jews in the district,
  who lived in tents and in wooden houses or huts. His contemporary,
  David Reubeni, who crossed from Arabia to Abyssinia and came to
  Europe in 1524, pretended to be brother of Joseph, king of the tribes
  of Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh in the desert of Chabor (Kheibar).
  Benjamin takes care to qualify his statement as to the origin of the
  Jews of Kheibar by adding <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image26.gif" width="170" height="17"> &quot;<i>people say</i> they belong
  to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, whom
  Salmanesser, King of Assyria, led hither into captivity.&quot;
</p><p>
  I would here mention an interesting work of Dr. R. Dozy, Professor
  of History and Oriental Languages at Leyden, <i>Die Israeliten in Mecca</i>,
  1864. By a series of ingenious inferences from Bible texts (1 Sam. xxx,
  1 Chron. iv. 24-43, &amp;c.) he essays to establish that the tribe of Simeon,
  after David had dispersed the Amalekites who had already been weakened
  by Saul, entered Arabia and settled all along in the land of the Minaeans
  and at Mecca, where they established the worship at the Kaaba and
  introduced practices which have not been altogether abandoned up to
  the present day. Dr. Dozy further contends that after Hezekiah's reign
  numerous Jewish exiles came to Arabia.
</p><p>
  Hommel, in two articles in Ersch and Gruber's <i>Encyclopaedia</i>, under &quot;Bedouins&quot;
  and &quot;Anzah,&quot; gives full particulars respecting the Anizeh, otherwise
  Anaessi, tribe&mdash;that they were in the habit of joining the Wahabees and
  other Bedouin tribes in attacking caravans and levying blackmail.
  The Turkish Pasha at Damascus had to pay annually passage-money
  to ensure the safety of the pilgrims to Mecca. On one occasion two of the
  Bedouin sheiks were decoyed by the Turks and killed; but the Anaessi,
  aided by other tribes to the number of 80,000, took ample revenge by
  pillaging the Mecca caravan on its return. They seized a quantity of
  pearls, and the women were said to have attempted boiling them with
  the rice. Seetzen (<i>Journey through Syria, &amp;c.</i>, I, ch. i, p. 356) says, &quot;In
  Kheibar are no Jews now, only Anaessi.&quot; Layard and other modern
  writers often refer to the Anizeh Bedouins. Travellers go in dread of
  them in the Syrian desert and all along the Euphrates. Doughty mentions
  that they, more than any other tribe, resemble the Jews both in
  appearance and disposition.
</p><p>
  Ritter (<i>Geographie</i>, vol. XII), in quoting Niebuhr, makes mention of
  the widespread Anizeh tribe of Bedouins who were anciently known to
  be Jews. He further states that the Jews of Damascus and Aleppo shun
  them as they are non-observant Jews, considered by some to be Karaites.
  Does all this give ground for any presumption that they are or were
  crypto-Jews, the descendants of the former Kheibar Jews, possibly also
  of those whom Omar allowed to settle at Kufa?
</p><p>
  This lengthy note may be closed fitly with the following mysterious
  remark in Doughty's usual quaint style (vol. I, p. 127), in connexion with
  the murder of a Bagdad Jew who tried to reach Kheibar: &quot;But let none
  any more jeopardy his life for Kheibar! I would that these leaves might
  save the blood of some: and God give me this reward of my labour! for
  who will, he may read in them all the tale of Kheibar.&quot;</p></div>

  Judah Al-harizi, being a description of a pilgrimage through Mesopotamia
  with a view to visit Ezra's grave. The Arab geographer Yakut locates
  the grave in the village Maisan on the river Samara near the place where
  the Euphrates and Tigris unite (<i>J. Q. R.</i>, vol. XV, 683). Layard writes as
  follows:&mdash;&quot;We stopped at the so-called tomb of the prophet Ezra, about
  twenty-five miles from the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, at Korna.
  The building, which is of a comparatively modern date, consisted of two
  chambers, an outer one which was empty, and an inner one containing
  the tomb built of bricks, covered with white stucco and enclosed in
  a wooden case, over which was thrown a large blue cloth fringed with
  yellow tassels with the name of the donor embroidered on it in Hebrew
  characters. No trace of either the large synagogue or of the mosque
  mentioned by Benjamin now exists, and it may be doubted whether the
  present building covers the tomb which was seen by the Hebrew
  traveller. We could find no ancient remains near it, as the Tigris is
  constantly changing its course, and was still eating away the bank of
  alluvial soil, upon the edge of which the building stood. It is highly
  probable that the tomb seen by Benjamin of Tudela had long before been
  carried away by the river.&quot; Layard's <i>Early Adventures in Persia, Susiana,
  and Babylonia</i>, vol. II, p. 214. See also an elaborate note of Dr. Benisch, p. 91

  Dizful in Persia, close by the river Shaour, an affluent of the Karun river,
  which is supposed to be the Ulai of the Bible, Dan. viii. 2. It is within
  sight of the vast mound which denotes the site of Susa, the ancient
  Shushan. Here Mme. Dieulafoy in 1881 made extensive excavations of
  the palace of the Persian kings, many relics of which are now on view at
  the Louvre in Paris.
</p><p>
  The tomb of Daniel has been fully described by Layard&mdash;see <i>Early
  Adventures</i>, vol. II, p. 295. It is of comparatively recent date, not unlike
  the shrines of Mussulman saints, and is surmounted by a high conical
  dome of irregular brickwork, somewhat resembling in shape a pine cone.
  The reader is referred to the beautiful pictorial illustrations of Daniel's
  reputed tomb, of the ruins of Susa, and of Schuster and its bridges in
  Mme. Dieulafoy's <i>La Perse, la Chald&eacute;e et la Susiane</i>, Paris, 1887.
</p><p>
  There is nothing to connect the building on the banks of the Shaour
  with the tomb of Daniel save the Mussulman tradition. There are many
  legends connected with the reputed sepulchre, one of which is to the
  effect that the men of Susa diverted the river in order to bury Daniel's
  coffin in its bed. See Guy Le Strange, p. 240.

  E.N. Adler, in his recent work <i>Jews in many Lands</i>, Jewish Historical
  Society of England, p. 224, in describing Samarkand, writes
  as follows: &quot;Tradition has it that Tamerlane had seen the tomb at Susa
  in Persia, with a warning inscribed thereon, that none should open its
  door; and so he broke it open from behind, and found it written that
  Nebi Daniel was there buried. The impetuous conqueror had the
  sarcophagus removed with all reverence, and carried it with him to his
  own capital to be its palladium. The sarcophagus is over twenty yards
  long as beseems a prophet's stature. It has been recently covered by
  a brick chapel with three cupolas, but photographs of the ancient
  structure can be had in Samarkand. It is grandly placed at the edge of
  a cliff overhanging the rapid river Seop. The local Jews do not believe
  the story, nor do they quite disbelieve it, for I went with two who prayed
  there at the grave of the righteous.&quot;</p></div>

  north of Mosul. Ben Virga and R. Joseph Hacohen, the author of <i>Emek
  Habacha</i>, state that 1,000 Jewish families lived in the city at that time.
  It is strange that in all the MSS., including Asher's text, this city is
  called Amaria instead of Amadia. The mistake doubtless arose from the
  fact that the copyists mistook the Hebrew letter 'resh' for a Hebrew letter 'daleth'. The scribe of the British

  1163. It should, however, be antedated by a few years. Benjamin must
  have passed through Egypt on his return journey some time before
  Sept., 1171. See note 2, p. 1. He here tells us that the Alroy catastrophe
  took place just ten years before his visit to Bagdad and the neighbourhood.

  Hacohen in <i>Emek Habacha</i>, are evidently based upon Benjamin's record,
  and throw no fresh light on this Messianic movement. Asher, vol. II,
  note 300, promises but fails to give the contents of an Arabic document
  written by a contemporary, the renegade Samuel Ibn Abbas, which the
  savant S. Munk had discovered in the Paris library; a German translation
  of this document appears in Dr. Wiener's <i>Emek Habacha</i>, 1858, p. 169. The
  name of the pseudo-Messiah is given as Menahem, surnamed Al-Ruhi,
  but Munk satisfactorily proves that he is identical with our David Alroy.
  Being a young man of engaging appearance and great accomplishments,
  he gained considerable influence with the governor of Amadia, and had
  a considerable following among the Jews of Persia. With the intention
  of occupying the castle, he introduced a number of his armed adherents
  into the town, who were careful, however, to conceal their weapons.
  The governor detected the conspiracy, and put Alroy to death. The
  excitement among the Jews lasted for a considerable time. Two impostors,
  with letters purporting to emanate from Alroy, came to Bagdad, and
  worked upon the credulity of the community. Men and women parted
  with their money and jewellery, having been brought to believe that on
  a certain night they would be able to fly on angels' wings from the roofs
  of their houses to Jerusalem. The only thing which made the women
  feel unhappy was the fear that their little ones might not be able to keep
  pace with them in the aerial flight. At daybreak the fraud was discovered,
  but the impostors had meanwhile decamped with their treasure.
  The chronicler adds that the year in which this occurred was called
  The Year of Flight.

  further particulars as to this tomb. Dr. J. E. Polak, formerly Physician
  to the late Shah of Persia, gives the desired information, on p. 26, in an
  interesting work on Persia. He writes as follows: &quot;The only national
  monument which the Jews in Persia possess is the tomb of Esther at
  Hamadan, the ancient Ecbatana, whither they have made pilgrimages
  from time immemorial. In the centre of the Jewish quarter there is to
  be seen a low building with a cupola, on the top of which a stork has
  built its nest. The entrance is walled up for the greater part; there
  only remains below a small aperture which can be closed by a movable
  flat stone serving the purpose of a door and affording some protection
  from attacks, which are not uncommon. In the entrance hall, which
  has but a low ceiling, are recorded the names of pilgrims; also the year
  when the building was restored. Thence one gains access into a small
  four-cornered chamber in which there are two high sarcophagi made of
  oak, which are the monuments of Esther and Mordecai. On both of them
  are inscribed in Hebrew the words of the last chapter of the Book of
  Esther, as well as the names of three Physicians at whose expense the
  tomb was repaired.&quot; Dr. Polak states that in the Middle Ages the Jewish
  population of Persia was very large, especially in the southern provinces.
  In recent years it has greatly diminished in consequence of dire persecution.
  He was assured that not more than 2,000 Jewish families remained
  in the country. Eighty years ago the entire community at Meshed were
  forcibly converted to Islam. Cf. E. N. Adler, <i>Jews in Many Lands</i>,
  p. 214.</p></div>

  the subject, with an illustration of the traditional tomb, as well as
  a picture of ancient Susa, will be found in the <i>Jewish Chronicle</i> of March 19,
  1897. In the issue of March 4, 1898, Mr. Morris Cohen, of Bagdad,
  furnished a full copy of the inscriptions in the Mausoleum, but they
  possess no historical value. The reputed Prayer of Esther seen there by
  former travellers is no longer extant.
</p><p>
  The statement of E. Jehiel Heilprin, in the <i>Seder Hadoroth</i>, that

  of two towns; the one called Jay, measured half a league across;
  the other, Al Yahudiyah, the &quot;Jew Town&quot; two miles to the westward,
  was double the size of Jay. Mukadassi states that the city had been
  originally founded by the Jews in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, because
  its climate resembled that of Jerusalem. Le Strange, p. 203.</p></div>

  a description of the City of Ispahan, and of his journey there. Chap. xx
  contains an account of his journey from Ispahan to Shiraz. The distance
  between the two cities is 81 parasangs, equivalent to 312 miles. It will
  be seen that here, as well as in the cases of Ghaznah, Samarkand, and
  Tibet, Benjamin altogether under-estimates the true distances.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_165_165" id="Footnote_165_165"></a><a href="#FNanchor_165_165"> [165]</a></p> <p> Asher, following the printed editions, quotes the Jewish population
  of this place as 8,000, and assumes, without any justification, that Khiva
  is here referred to. He also substitutes Oxus for Gozan. In the Middle
  Ages the Oxus was known under the name of Jayhun or Gihon
  (Gen. ii. 13). The name of the city according to our text is Ghaznah,
  which eight hundred years ago was the capital of Afghanistan. Ibn Batuta
  says it was ten stages from Kandahar on the way to Herat. Le Strange
  (p. 348) writes as follows: &quot;Ghaznah became famous in history at the
  beginning of the eleventh century as the capital of the great Mahmud of
  Ghaznah, who at one time was master both of India on the east and
  Bagdad on the west.&quot; Istakhri says: &quot;No city of this countryside was
  richer in merchants and merchandise, for it was as the port of India.&quot;
  The river Gozan, on which we are told Ghaznah lies, must appear to the
  reader to be ubiquitous. On p. 33 we find the Habor of Kurdistan is its
  affluent; on p. 55 it is at Dabaristan; on p. 59 in Khorasan. There
  is a simple solution of the difficulty. In each of the localities Benjamin
  was told that the river was called Gozan; for in the Mongolian language
   &quot;Usun&quot; is the name for water or river. Thus &quot;Kisil-Usun&quot; means
  &quot;Red River.&quot; The addition of a &quot;g&quot; before a &quot;u&quot; or &quot;w&quot; is quite
  a common feature in language; it occurs, for instance, in the Romance
  and Keltic languages.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_166_166" id="Footnote_166_166"></a><a href="#FNanchor_166_166"> [166]</a></p> <p> The British Museum text has: &quot;And he put them in Halah and in
  Habor and the mountains of Gozan and the mountains of the Medes.&quot;
  Having regard to the passages 2 Kings xix. 12 and Isaiah xxxvii. 12,
  N&ouml;ldeke maintains that there was a tract of land watered by the river
  Gozan, known as Gozanitis, which Scripture refers to. See <i>J. Q. R.</i>, vol. I,
  p. 186.

  Naisabur is a city near Meshed, and close to high mountains which

  We draw attention to the cautious manner in which Benjamin speaks
  here and elsewhere when alluding to the whereabouts of any of the
  ten tribes. The tradition is widespread that independent Jewish tribes
  were to be found in Khorasan until recent times. Mr. E. N. Adler was
  told that in an Armenian monastery near Kutais, ancient records are
  preserved which conclusively prove that the Jews were paramount in
  certain districts three or four centuries ago; <i>Jews in many Lands</i>,
  p. 178. Cf. <i>Wo w&auml;ren die zehn St&auml;mme Israels zu suchen?</i> Dr. M. Lewin,

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_167_167" id="Footnote_167_167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_167_167"> [167]</a></p> <p> It should be remembered that <i>Cush</i> in ancient Jewish literature does
  not always signify Ethiopia, but also denotes parts of Arabia, especially
  those nearest to Abyssinia. The name <i>Cush</i> is also applied to countries
  east of the Tigris, see p. 63.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_169_169" id="Footnote_169_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_169_169"> [169]</a></p> <p> The incidents here related are fully gone into by Dr. Neubauer in the
  third of his valuable articles &quot;Where are the ten tribes?&quot; (<i>J. Q. R.</i>, vol. I,
  p. 185). There can be little doubt that the Kofar-al-Turak, a people
  belonging to the Tartar stock, are identical with the so-called subjects of
  Prester John, of whom so much was heard in the Middle Ages. They
  defeated Sinjar in the year 1141; this was, however, more than fifteen
  years prior to Benjamin's visit. To judge from the above passage, where
  the allies of the Jews are described as &quot;infidels, the sons of Ghuz of the
  Kofar-al-Turak,&quot; Benjamin seems to confound the Ghuzes with the Tartar
  hordes. Now the Ghuzes belonged to the Seldjuk clans who had become
  Mohammedans more than 100 years before, and, as such, Benjamin would
  never have styled them infidels. These Ghuzes waged war with Sinjar
  in 1153, when he was signally defeated, and eventually made prisoner.
  It is to this battle that Benjamin must have made reference, when he
  writes that it took place fifteen years ago. See Dr. A. M&uuml;ller's <i>Islam,</i>
  also Dr. G. Oppert's <i>Presbyter Johannes in Sage und Geschichte, 1864.</i></p></div>

</p><p>
  In the Middle Ages the island of Kish or Kis was an important
  station on the trade route from India to Europe. Le Strange writes,
  p. 257, that in the course of the twelfth century it became the trade
  centre of the Persian Gulf. A great walled city was built in the island,
  where water-tanks had been constructed, and on the neighbouring
  sea-banks
  was the famous pearl-fishery. Ships from India and Arabia crowded
  the port. Kish was afterwards supplanted by Ormuz and Bandar-Abbas;
  England held possession of the island from 1820 to 1879, and it has
  recently been visited officially by Lord Curzon. For a description of the
  island see <i>The Times,</i> Jan. 18, 1904.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_171_171" id="Footnote_171_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_171_171"> [171]</a></p> <p> Katifa or El-Katif lies on the Persian Gulf, on the East coast of Arabia,
  near Bahrein. Bochart is of opinion that this part of Arabia is the land
  of Havilah, where, according to Gen. ii. 11 and 12, there is gold, bdellium,
  and the onyx stone. Jewish authorities are divided in opinion as to
  whether <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image58.gif" width="35" height="17"> is a jewel, or the fragrant gum exuded by a species of balsam-tree.
  Benjamin follows Saadia Gaon, who in his Arabic translation of
  the Bible renders it <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image59.gif" width="42" height="19">, the very word used by our author here for pearls.
  Masudi is one of the earliest Arabic writers who gives us a description of
  the pearl-fisheries in the Persian Gulf, and it very much accords with
  Benjamin's account. See Sprenger's translation of Masudi's <i>Meadows of
  Gold</i>, p. 344. At the present time more than 5,000 boats are engaged in
  this industry along this coast, and it yields an annual income of
  &pound;1,000,000. See P. M. Sykes, <i>Ten Thousand Miles in Persia</i>, 1902.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_172_172" id="Footnote_172_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172_172"> [172]</a></p> <p> Khulam, now called Quilon, was a much frequented seaport in the
  early Middle Ages where Chinese shippers met the Arab traders. It
  afterwards declined in importance, being supplanted by Calicut, Goa, and
  eventually by Bombay. It was situated at the southern end of the coast
  of Malabar. Renaudot in a translation of <i>The Travels of Two Mohammedan
  Traders</i>, who wrote as far back as 851 and 915 respectively, has given us
  some account of this place; Ibn Batuta and Marco Polo give us interesting
  details. Ritter, in the fifth volume of his Geography, dilates
  on the cultivation of the pepper-plant, which is of indigenous growth.
  In Benjamin's time it was thought that white pepper was a distinct
  species, but Ritter explains that it was prepared from the black pepper,
  which, after lying from eight to ten days in running water, would <ins class="correction"
  Title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'admi'">
admit</ins>


  of being stripped of its black outer covering. Ritter devotes a chapter to
  the fire-worship of the Guebers, who, as Parsees, form an important
  element at the present day in the population of the Bombay Presidency.
  Another chapter is devoted to the Jewish settlement to which Benjamin
  refers. See <i>Die j&uuml;dischen Colonien in Indien</i>, Dr. Gustav Oppert; also
  <i>Semitic Studies</i>, (Berlin,1897), pp. 396-419.

  Under the heading of &quot;Cochin&quot;, the Jewish Encyclopaedia gives an account
  of the White and Black Jews of Malabar. By way of supplementing the
  Article, it may be well to refer to a MS., No. 4238 of the Merzbacher Library
  formerly at Munich. It is a document drawn up in reply to eleven questions
  addressed by Tobias Boas on the 12 Ellul 5527 (= 1767) to R. Jeches Kel
  Rachbi of Malabar. From this MS. it appears that 10,000 exiled Jews
  reached Malabar A. C. 68 (i. e. about the time of the destruction of the
  Second Temple) and settled at Cranganor, Dschalor, Madri and Plota.

  indicated by Benjamin, it is surprising that we have comparatively little
  information about India and China from Arabic sources. In none of
  their records is the Sea of Nikpa named, and it is not improbable that
  Benjamin coined this name himself from the root <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image30.gif" width="31" height="16"> which occurs in
  the Bible four times; in the Song of Moses (Exod. xv. 8): <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image31.gif" width="157" height="16">
  &quot;The depths were curdled in the heart of the sea&quot; (not &quot;<i>congealed</i>&quot; as the
  Version has it), Job x. 10: <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image32.gif" width="123" height="17"> &quot;curdled me like cheese&quot;; and
  in Zeph. i. 12 and Zech. xiv. 6. The term &quot;the curdling sea&quot; would
  be very expressive of the tempestuous nature of the China Sea and of some
  of its straits at certain seasons of the year.</p></div>

  of the sea-currents which drive ships from Malabar to Madagascar. He
  says, vol. II, book III, chap. 33: &quot;It is for all the world like an eagle,
  but one indeed of enormous size. It is so strong that it will seize an
  elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air and drop him so
  that he is smashed to pieces; having so killed him, the gryphon swoops
  down on him and eats him at leisure. The people of those isles call the
  bird 'Rukh.'&quot; Yule has an interesting note (vol. II, p. 348) showing
  how old and widespread the fable of the Rukh was, and is of opinion
  that the reason that the legend was localized in the direction of Madagascar
  was perhaps that some remains of the great fossil Aepyornis and its
  colossal eggs were found in that island. Professor Sayce states that the
  Rukh figures much&mdash;not only in Chinese folk-lore&mdash;but also in the old,
  Babylonian literature. The bird is of course familiar to readers of
  <i>The Arabian Nights</i>.</p></div>

  Benjamin has already made it clear that to get from India to China takes
  sixty-three days, that is to say twenty-three days from Khulam to Ibrig,
  and thence forty days to the sea of Nikpa. The return journey, not
  merely to India but to Zebid, which Abulfeda and Alberuni call the
  principal port of Yemen, seems to take but thirty-four days. With regard
  to Aden, the port long in England's possession, and the so-called first
  outpost of the Indian Empire, it has already been explained (p. 50) that
  this part of Arabia as well as Abyssinia on the other side of the Red Sea
  were considered part of Middle India. Ibn Batuta says about Aden:
  &quot;It is situated on the sea-shore and is a large city, but without either
  seed, water, or tree. They have reservoirs in which they collect the rain
  for drinking. Some rich merchants reside here, and vessels from India
  occasionally arrive.&quot; A Jewish community has been there from time
  immemorial. The men until recent times used to go about all day in
  their Tephillin. Jacob Saphir devotes vol. II, chaps, i-x of his <i>Eben
  Saphir</i>, to a full account of the Jews of Aden.</p></div>

  Jews who lived in the mountainous country in the rear of
  Aden crossed the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb and made war against the
  inhabitants of the Plains of Abyssinia. J. Lelewel, in a series of
  letters addressed to E. Carmoly, entitled <i>Examen geographique des Voyages

  other attempts at identification. The Jews coming from Aden had to
  encounter the forces of the Christian sovereign of Abyssinia, and sought
  safety in the mountainous regions of that country. Here they were
  heard of later under the name of Falasha Jews. Cf. Marco Polo, vol. III,
  chap. xxxv. The reader is referred to Colonel Yule's valuable notes to
  this chapter. He quotes Bruce's <i>Abstract of Abyssinian Chronicles</i> with
  regard to a Jewish dynasty which superseded the royal line in the tenth
  century. See also Dr. Charles Singer's interesting communication in

  The Arab story is that when Joseph was getting old the courtiers tried

  artificially
  adapting a natural branch of the Nile so as to give the district
  the benefit of the yearly overflow. The canal thus formed, which is 207

  vol. XVIII, 1, give us very interesting information respecting Fostat
  and Cairo, as derived from Geniza documents, but to comprehend fully
  Benjamin's account, we must remember that at the time of his visit
  the metropolis was passing through a crisis. Since March, 1169, Saladin
  had virtually become the ruler of Egypt, although nominally he acted
  as Vizier to the Caliph El-Adid, who was the last of the Fatimite
  line, and who died Sept. 13, 1171, three days after his deposition.
  The student is referred to the biography of Saladin by Mr. Stanley
  Lane Poole, 1878. Chap, viii gives a full account of Cairo as at 1170
  and is accompanied by a map. The well-known citadel of Cairo,
  standing on the spurs of the Mukattam Hills, was erected by Saladin
  seven years later. The Cairo of 1170, which was styled El Medina,
  and was called by Benjamin <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image36.gif" width="150" height="16">, was founded in 969, and
  consisted of an immense palace for the Caliph and his large household.
  It was surrounded by quarters for a large army, and edifices for the
  ministers and government offices. The whole was protected by massive
  walls and imposing Norman-like gates. The civil population&mdash;more
  particularly the Jews&mdash;dwelt in the old Kasr-esh-Shama quarter round
  the so-called Castle of Babylon, also in the city of Fostat, founded in
  641, and in the El-Askar quarter, which was built in 751. These
  suburbs went under the name of Misr or Masr, but are called by
  Benjamin &quot;Mizraim.&quot; Fostat was set on fire on Nov. 12, 1168, by the
  order of the Vizier Shawar, in order that it might not give shelter to the
  Franks who had invaded Egypt, but was soon rebuilt in part. It now
  goes under the name Masr-el-Atika, and is noted at the present day for
  its immense rubbish heaps. See Stanley Lane Poole's <i>Cairo</i>, p. 34.</p></div>

  is identical with Hibet Allah ibn al Jami, who later on became Saladin's
  physician (Asher, vol. II, p. 253). Graetz, vol. VI, p. 307, inclines to the
  same view. Dr. Steinschneider, <i>Die arabische Literatur der Juden</i>, 1902,
  p. 178, confirms this opinion, and gives a detailed account of Hibet
  Allah's medical and philosophical works. Dr. Neubauer, in an article,
  <i>J.Q.R.</i>, VIII, 541, draws attention to a Geniza fragment which contains
  a marriage contract dated 1160, wherein R. Nethanel is called a Levite.
  Benjamin does not style him so here. The same article contains the
  so-called
  Suttah Megillah, on which Professor Kaufmann comments, <i>J.Q.R.</i>,
  X, p. 171. It would appear that R. Nethanel never attained the dignity
  of Nagid. During Benjamin's visit to Egypt Sutta, in his capacity of
  Chief Collector of Taxes, filled nominally that office. Later on, after
  Sutta's fall, the dignity of Nagid was offered to Moses Maimonides, but
  was not accepted by him.</p></div>

  Geniza manuscripts were found. See E. N. Adler's <i>Jews in Many Lands</i>,
  p. 28, also <i>J.Q.R.</i>, IX, 669. The Nilometer is in a square well 16 feet in
  diameter, having in the centre a graduated octagonal column with Cufic
  inscriptions, and is 17 cubits in height, the cubit being 21-1/3 inches. The
  water of the Nile, when at its lowest, covers 7 cubits of the Nilometer,
  and when it reaches a height of 15-2/3 cubits the Sheikh of the Nile proclaims
  the Wefa, i.e., that the height of the water necessary for irrigating
  every part of the Nile valley has been attained. The signal is then given
  for the cutting of the embankment. We know that the column of the
  Nilometer has been frequently repaired, which fact explains the apparent

  notable example is the application of the name of Zoan to Cairo.
  Ancient Tanis (p. 78) was probably Zoan, and we are told (Num. xiii.

  world. As the coast was low and there were no landmarks, it proved
  of great service to the city. It was built of white marble, and on the
  top there blazed a huge beacon of logs saturated with pitch. Abulfeda

  being protected by coral reefs. It can be reached from the monastery
  in little more than a day. The small mountain referred to by Benjamin
  is the Jebel Hammam Sidna Musa, the mountain of the bath of our lord
  Moses.</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_204_204" id="Footnote_204_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_204_204"> [204]</a></p> <p> Tanis, now called San, was probably the Zoan of Scripture, but in
  the Middle Ages it was held to be Hanes, mentioned in Isa. xxx. 4.
  It was situated on the eastern bank of the Tanitic branch of the Nile,
  about thirty miles south-west of the ancient Pelusium. The excavations
  which have been made by M. Mariette and Mr. Flinders Petrie prove
  that it was one of the largest and most important cities of the Delta. It
  forms the subject of the Second Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund,
  1885. The place must not be confounded with the seaport town Tennis,
  as has been done by Asher. In the sixth century the waters of the Lake
  Menzaleh invaded a large portion of the fertile Tanis territory. Hence
  Benjamin calls it an island in the midst of the sea. In a Geniza document
  dated 1106, quoted by Dr. Schechter, <i>Saadyana</i>, p. 91, occurs the
  passage:<br /> <br />
 <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image43.gif" width="474" height="18"> &quot; <br />In the
  city of the isle Hanes, which is in the midst of the sea and of the tongue
  of the river of Egypt called Nile.&quot;</p></div>

  <div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_209_209" id="Footnote_209_209"></a><a href="#FNanchor_209_209"> [209]</a></p> <p> King William II, surnamed &quot;the Good,&quot; was sixteen years old when
  Benjamin visited Sicily in 1170. During the king's minority the Archbishop
  was the vice-regent. He was expelled in 1169 on account of his
  unpopularity. Asher asserts that Benjamin's visit must have taken
  place prior to this date, because he reads <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image45.gif" width="183" height="20"> <i>This is the
  domain of the viceroy.</i> The Oxford MS. agrees with our text and reads
  <img alt="Hebrew: " src="images/image46.gif" width="169" height="20"> <i>This is the domain of the king's garden.</i> Chroniclers tell
  that when the young king was freed from the control of the viceroy he
  gave himself up to pleasure and dissipation. Asher is clearly wrong,
  because a mere boy could not have indulged in those frolics. The point
  is of importance, as it absolutely fixes the date of Benjamin's visit to the
  island. It was in the year 1177 that William married the daughter of
  our English king, Henry II.</p></div>

  King Roger II, calls the island a pearl, and cannot find words sufficient
  in praise of its climate, beauty, and fertility. He is especially enthusiastic
  concerning Palermo. Petralia is described by him as being a fortified
  place, and an excellent place of refuge, the surrounding country being
  under a high state of cultivation and very productive. Asher has no
  justification for reading Pantaleoni instead of Petralia.</p></div>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
